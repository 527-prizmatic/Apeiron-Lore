				<p class="content">Strangely enough, one of Apeiron's most bustling businesses is headhunting. A lot of corporations are willing to pay fortunes to organize a concurrent's demise, a gang's survival may rely on having a cargo of stolen goods transported across town, and a journalist may be looking for some crunchy information about somebody. The job is a dirty one, but <b>it pays disgustingly well</b>, and can earn you a lot of reputation in the circle.</p>
				
				<p class="content">A mercenary's job can take on many faces, and <b>is usually at the limits of legality</b>, that is why the job requires stealth and precaution. Mercenaries themselves can come from any background, and the mercenary circle is in fact one of the rare enviroments where corporates will willingly accept to work with wretched people, and vice versa. <b>Sometimes, employers do not want to meet mercenaries face-to-face</b>, and instead rely on mediators and fixers. Mercenaries usually prowl around and do the job in small teams, as one person rarely has enough expertise to do all kinds of jobs; in some occasions, they even gather into larger organizations, acting as hubs for mercenaries to meet up with colleagues and partake on jobs together.</p>
