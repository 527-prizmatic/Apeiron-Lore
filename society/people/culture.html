				<p class="content">The invention of new, ever-better technologies almost instantly gave rise to new forms of entertainment, as people tend to hate being bored. Almost all domains have been revolutionized in some way - from board games to movies, from graphic art to books, every sector has been enhanced in some way or another thanks to new technological developments.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The one breakthrough to rule them all is incontestably the holographic projector (commonly known as "H-pro", or simply "H"). The technology uses <b>an array of light projectors emitting energy at different wavelengths to polarize the molecules of air above it</b> in very specific patterns through a complex game of electromagnetic interferences, and special specs are required to watch the projection, as the polarized air gives off its radiation on a wavelength invisible to the human eye. Basic H-pros render in monochrome, which is usually enough for most usages, but more advanced ones can render with up to a 12-bit color depth. The technology was invented a few years before the Heliostat's destruction, as a tool to assist engineers in properly visualizing their models, but was quickly generalized to the domain of entertainment, and as of today is used practically exclusively for this intent. Most technologies that use hologram-based displays are given the prefix "H" by convention (such as "H-screen").</p>
				
				<p class="content">H-pros and H-recorders are now used practically anywhere. Most board games have been replaced with interactive H-pros, detecting hand movements by reading interferences in a secondary electromagnetic field, a bit like a MRI. <b>H-movies, or holoscapes, are particularly popular</b>, as being able to move around the scene to view it in different angles, and watch a life-sized gunfight as if you were there, is a truly mystifying experience, although a quite luxury one; only three establishments in Apeiron offer holoscapes, and to avoid overcrowding, each projection is usually limited to a dozen spectators at once. Most concert halls dispose of a few H-pros scattered around the spectator area, offering a real-time projection of the artists for those in the back who wouldn't be able to see them. A technology that is still experimental as of 285 PC allows to generate a miniature, crude holoscape in real time, based on a piece of text read aloud by the user.</p>
