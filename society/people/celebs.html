				<p class="content">In every civilization, whatever the era, there are some great names that stand out from the masses not because of discoveries or initiatives, but because of their creativity. In a world where technology allows to transmit all sorts of info across the globe, something famous somewhere will inevitably gain media coverage all over the world. It's even easier when a third of the world's media coverage happens to be governed by Rosa Infra WLLC alone.</p>
				
				<p class="content">This article won't try to explain to you what is a celebrity or anything, it will simply provide a little (non exhaustive, that would be impossible) list of the greatest names of modern pop culture, the ones that inevitably trigger a reaction at the sole utterance of the name.</p>
				
				<h3>Some Famous People</h3>
				
				<h4><b>NOTE - THIS LIST IS INCOMPLETE, IT WILL BE EXPANDED LATER</b></h4>
				
				<p class="content"><b>Andrēas "Powerwolf" G-jānovolos</b> - Most famously known under his radio name Powerwolf, this charismatic man in his mid-40s is the lead announcer of Apeiron's No.1 radio channel <b>Galaxy News Radio</b>. Always happy to give personal anectotes on the air, almost everyone in Apeiron knows that he comes from a rural meridional country, and his family emigrated in Apeiron at age 14 after an earthquake destroyed his native village. He initially joined Rosa Infra WLLC as intern to make some extra money, and the company quickly noticed him for his lively personality and exotic demeanor. He eventually was invited to join a small radio channel as a full-time co-announcer, and became increasingly successful among the audience, which slowly but surely led him to his current position. He is an impressively charismatic man, constantly overflowing with energy and enthusiasm; his exotic origins grant him a quite unique personality and demeanor which play a great role in making him a truly irreplacable character.</p>
				
				<p class="content"><b>Victoria "Valkyrie" Vasquez</b> - Lead singer and guitarist of a small neon punk band, Valkyrie would probably have stayed niche for her whole career if  she hadn't been propelled to fame after one of her concerts was hijacked by a failed criminal suicide attack. Born from an extremely rich traditionalist family, her tiger parents oppressively destined her against her will to transbioscience, but also requested that she takes classes of classical music on the side. Eventually, being unable to keep up with both, she would drop out of TBS to become dedicated to music, moved to Infinium City, and formed a band with some like-minded nonconformists. They quickly became quite the phenomenon in the ghettos of Systemis, thanks to their strongly political and anti-system songs, and their delightfully aggressive musical style. Rosa Infra deliberately refuses to broadcast the band's music due to their anti-corporation lyrics, which largely prevented them from becoming widely famous, until recently.</p>
