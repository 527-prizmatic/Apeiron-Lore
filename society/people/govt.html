				<h1>Apeiron's Government</h1>
				<h2>Personalities & Politics</h2>
			</div>
			<div id="h-sep"></div>
			<div id="main">
			
				<p class="content">Apeiron is a rather unique political entity, as it does not have any proper government per se. The island is in fact a <b>federation constituted of four city-states</b>, corresponding to the four main cities and a small perimeter around them, separated by vast swathes of polar wasteland which, despite being technically independent from the Federation, are in fact "governed" by all four states at once. Each city-state is then subdivided in districts, which are considered as independent from each other for a few low-impact purposes.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Each city-state is governed by a small circle of politicians, constituted of <b>a mayor and a couple deputies, all elected by the people of each city-state</b>. The Supernova has no representatives, instead falling under the same legislation as the neutral territories. Elections take place every six years, and unfold in two phases. The first phase consists in electing the deputies; each of the city-state's districts presents three candidates, and the entire city chooses one deputy for each district (with the voters of each district having a little more weight when it comes to electing their own deputy). Once the deputies are elected, comes the time to elect a mayor; most usually, the mayoral election opposes the leaving candidate against one to four opponents. it is quite frequent for the leaving mayor to be elected again, and on one occurence, the same man managed to stay as mayor of Volnexar for a walloping 36 years, from 206 to 242 PC, before eventually being forcibly kicked out of his office by the Federation, "to bring some fresh ideas to the city's government".</p>
				
				<p class="content">This council of deputies, presided and directed by the mayor, has absolute powers for any matters regarding the city itself, but any decision that could potentially impact either another city-state or the barren wastes in any way must be run through the "general council". This council <b>simply consists in the Federation's four mayors</b> gathering to talk about the submitted project. If it is approved by the council, it is then run through the four cities' deputies, which eventually have the final say in whether the project can be carried out. This last phase sometimes involves surveys among the Federation's population, to ensure it would not have a negative impact on quality of life.</p>
				
				<p class="content">A generic trend has been picked up among the Federation's governments; it seems that most members of past governments had a financial or even corporate background. This may explain why some corporations have been allowed to carry out a few quite massive projects without any concertation with the public.</p>
				
				<h3>Current Government</h3>
				
				<p class="content">As of January 285 PC, the Federation's general council is comprised of these four fine folks:</p>
				
				<p class="content"><b><span class="unit" title="&quot;Amigje&quot;, a female Planetary honorific roughly translating to &quot;Lady&quot; &#13;&#10; Rough English transcription: [ah-ME-giè] &#13;&#10; IPA: [a.ˈmi.gʲɛ]">Ag.</span> Zinaida &quot;Oculus&quot; Arismana, Mayor of Starcaller Prime</b> - a veteran of big corporations, Ag. Arismana has worked as a high-ranking executive of Halkeiro Stellar Techs Inc. for nearly 25 years, and left the company after exposing a large-scale affair of corruption with the company. Profiting from the massive boost in popularity this scandal granted her, she quickly became favorite in the 273 PC mayorals, and thanks to her juggernaut politics on redistribution of wealth, she seems well in line for a third mandate... at least, for as long as the corporations she made herself an enemy of don't take action against her.</p>
				
				<p class="content"><b><span class="unit" title="&quot;Amizki&quot;, a non-binary Planetary honorific which can be considered as a non-binary equivalent of &quot;Sir&quot;. Planetary takes great pride in &#13;&#10; its innate grammatical distinction between biological genders and gender identity, claiming it to be a rather visionary feature &#13;&#10; Rough English transcription: [ah-MIEGE-key] &#13;&#10; IPA: [a.ˈmiʑ.ki]">Az.</span> Dhestall &quot;Majra&quot; Sterdaris, Mayor of Zandara-5</b> - a quite eccentric individual who arrived a bit out of nowhere. Their lack of experience in the political domain raised a few concerns about whether they'll be able to govern properly, but their heavily culture-oriented program was widely acclaimed, as culture is commonly seen as somewhat lacking on Apeiron. They mostly rely on their deputies to guide them in their political decisions, and often come to the general council's sittings accompanied with one of them to help them decipher situations they feel like they're unable to understand.</p>
				
				<p class="content"><b><span class="unit" title="&quot;Amikan&quot;, a male Planetary honorific roughly translating to &quot;Sir&quot; &#13;&#10; Rough English transcription: [ah-ME-can] &#13;&#10; IPA: [a.ˈmi.kan]">Ak.</span> Endrike &quot;Kalsvyra&quot; Kunstmann, Mayor of Infinium City</b> - an imposing man who served in the AZN for nearly ten years. His presence and leadership led him to climb up the ranks very quickly, eventually raising to the rank of district general - the third-highest rank of the AZN, just below state general and Federation marshall. He primarily decided to apply his skills to politics as his frequent missions within Infinium City led him to assess the city's crime rates were in a disastrous state, and believed his experience of the military would be an invaluable asset in fighting criminality. So far it proved quite effective, as Infinium City's homicide rate decreased by 11% since his election. By an interesting correlation, the AZN seems much more active in Infinium City since he's here.</p>
				
				<p class="content"><b><span class="unit" title="&quot;Amikan&quot;, a male Planetary honorific roughly translating to &quot;Sir&quot; &#13;&#10; Rough English transcription: [ah-ME-can] &#13;&#10; IPA: [a.ˈmi.kan]">Ak.</span> Ma'endra &quot;Ekata&quot; Vazkanar, Mayor of Volnexar</b> - the current senior vice-president of Kevell Arsenal Co. also doubles as Volnexar's current mayor. He has very few political ambition, and his program mostly revolves around improving Apeiron's security services, starting by giving the AZN some more breathing space; his arrival to his position is frequently questioned, as it's easy to wonder who voted for this guy, but his deputies seem to do most of the job relatively well...</p>
