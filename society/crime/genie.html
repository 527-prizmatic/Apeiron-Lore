				<p class="content">One of Infinium's oldest organized gangs was founded around 210 PC, a time where massive breakthroughs in biotechnologies made possible the generalization of the previously quite dangerous and invasive E-cybertech. Starting from the principle that the instinct of all lifeforms pushes them to thrive and expand, they firmly believe <b>humanity's final objective in this universe is to transcend their mortal form</b>, and believe it can be achieved most easily through intensive use of cybernetics - essentially turning human beings into ships of Theseus, where most biology has been replaced by silicon and metal. Unfortunately, this almost noble quest to find immortality suffered from the criminally stained environment and quickly turned into a <b>frantic quest to turn the entirety of humanity into cyborgs</b>.</p>

				<p class="content">Their methods are quite simple. They seek for people who seem unhappy with their life, kidnap them, and install into them a swarm of cybernetic enhancements. To this purpose, they are divided into three branches:</p>

				<p class="content"><b>Eyes</b>, who are most often found on the streets, to find potential targets. They tend to prowl in spread-out groups of four to eight, mostly targeting highly populated areas, and are the leading branch of the gang.</p>

				<p class="content"><b>Arms</b>, whose primary job is to supply the gang with the finest cyberware. They target warehouses, convoys and laboratories, unsatisfied with what's available in the commerce, always looking for the best of the best. They are most often found in groups of four (coordinator, muscle, technician, watcher), and seeing them is generally a sign of gang activity in the area.</p>

				<p class="content"><b>Hands</b>, by far the minority, they are the doctors and surgeons of the gang. Most of them are very imprecise as either self-taught or were taught by older Hands, and as such are usually the ones with the most murders on the conscience. They work in the background, hidden in the gang's hideouts spread throughout the city.</p>

				<p class="content">The gang does not have a particular hierarchy, but do have a boss (known among them as the <b>Mastershit</b>) whose job is to coordinate the Eyes' operations. He monitors the stocks of stolen cyberware and commands the Eyes to look for new victims once the Arms will have gathered enough material. The Hands have no particular order; their only job is to take whoever the Eyes bring them and stuff them with whatever the Arms bring them. Within the different branches, <b>members tend to assemble with whoever they prefer for their operations</b>, and within a team, the "leader" is generally the one with the most eye-catching style; as such, the gang's dress code is extremely flashy, composed of powerfully contrasting neon colors, ornate with glowsticks and plastic ornaments.</p>

				<p class="content">In general, the gang is not considered as hostile by the police services, as they do not actively seek to harm people, consider themselves being helpful, and almost always release the people they captured without asking for a ransom (save for the ones who died under the scalpel of a Hand in training). However, their active cyberware thievery and trafficking is seen as such by most corporations, as potentially detrimental to their economy and research, and some such as Tetractys will <b>almost never hesitate to call the AZN</b> upon even a single member.</p>
