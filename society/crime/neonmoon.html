				<p class="content">A mysterious organization believed be based in Infinium City's rich suburbs, the small group known as Neon Moon has <b>quickly achieved fame throughout the Federation for posing an extremely high threat to the economy's integrity</b>. The small gang is a small neutral hacktivist group specialized in mudslinging, working for no particular interests other than striving to re-establish truth and trust among the Federation, by <b>revealing the darkest secrets of powerful organizations</b> and corporations. Being neutral and fighting against everybody, Neon Moon has incurred the wrath of many companies throughout the years, and they are now classified by the AZN as one of the most dangerous criminal organizations on the continent.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Practically nothing is known about them nor their modus operandi, as they are extremely skilled and always work in the shadows. Based on sightings and rumors, they tend to boast a particular aesthetic based on dark colors, to blend more easily in the crowd and avoid drawing suspicion. They work in a very straightforward fashion, consisting in simply <b>hacking into a corporation's database and steal as much data as possible</b>, then pick the most scandalous files and leak them on Internet with a catchy title. What time they save by making their job simple and direct, is invested in developing extreme precautions, profuse countermeasures and nearly impenetrable databases. Whether in the city or on Internet, nobody has ever breached Neon Moon's defenses, and everything about them stays a mystery.</p>
