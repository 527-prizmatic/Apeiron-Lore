				<p class="content">While the Genie's whole deal is to push man to transcend mortal bodies through cyberware, Na Kua Honua is the polar opposite, believing the answer to all ailments lies in nature and its products, and seeking to prove it to the world. The gang was officially <b>founded around 250 PC as a merger of a large collection of small gangs and drug dealers</b>, brought together by their <b>love of alternative medicine</b> and knowledge of biochemistry. Their activities include smuggling of all sorts of herbs, homeopathic products and natural drugs, all around the eperopolis, but mostly focused around Infinium City's northern districts.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The gang's structure is composed of <b>a large gathering of small "squads", all named after birds</b>, all of which holds one of their "shops", effectively <b>stashes and selling points</b>. Their dress code usually comports colorful accessories, natural fabrics and all sorts of colorful and shiny jewellery, most often made out of wood and feathers. They make their own jackets, following a very stylish asymmetric cut, and with a stylized depiction of their squad's banner bird on the back. Their uniquely modular organization, lack of a centralized leader, and network-like structure, makes them a particularly resilient gang, <b>quite reminiscing of Rosa Infra WLLC's structure</b>. They are renowned for being very reliable, valuing their customer above all, and providing an impressive variety of products for everyone's tastes.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The gang grows most of their products, and has contacts all around the world to get their more exotic ones; <b>their entire trade is done by the books, without stealing a single infiar</b> or gram of powder. Their greenhouses are generally underground, and filled with thaumotics to monitor hygrometry, air temperature and purity, to ensure their plants grow in optimal conditions. The last factor is quite important as the gang discovered the hard way that diastrophin has highly unpredictable effects on most plants' metabolism, making them synthetize some compounds in unexpected ways - a few gang members died of overdose in a farm accident some years ago, when the plants evolved in a way making them release their raw, unfiltered active molecules into the air around them.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Their reputation <b>quickly brought them higher than most gangs</b> as they are occasionally contacted by famous or influential people looking to try out alternative methods to get shitfaced. They have long-term contracts with rich people wanting to fuel their addiction to some exotic and very expensive drug, allowing them to keep a nice little fortune in their pockets. The gang's assets are scattered around the different squads, in such a way that the gang is effectively not a single gang but a large collection of small gangs orchestrated a single "command center", a small council made up of the leader of the four most powerful squads (the ranking of which is updated weekly).</p>
