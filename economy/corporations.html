				<p class="content">Something that is still hard to fathom for many people is that approximately 90% of life within Apeiron was provided by the work of <b>a mere six corporations</b>. The apartment building you live in, the electricity powering it, the automata taking good care of it, the furniture of your apartment, your food and water, your clothes, even up to the silicon that's in your body, nearly everything has gone through the desks of a small handful of corporations. Valuing the true extent of their grasp on our world would be nearly impossible, but it is generally considered that without them and their contributions to our quality of life, the world would have been reduced to ashes two centuries ago.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Of course, such a monopoly is rather questionable, when you know that these six mega-corporations alone represent approximately <b>one quarter of Apeiron's wealth</b>. but this is usually not questioned, as the few people who tried to take any drastic action against them disappeared in unexplained circumstances. This series of articles will introduce you to the six members of this economical bulwark, as well as a few other corporations, not as wealthy and esteemed as the previous ones but certainly just as famous. It will also provide you a few insights on Apeiron's currency, the Infiar.</p>
