				<p class="content">While the different countries in the world may use various currencies with different values based on the local economy, creating a standard unit of currency is vital for proper operation of any sort of stock market. To this purpose was created the <b>univar</b> (UNI, for <b>UNI</b>var).</p>
				
				<p class="content">The univar has been in use for almost five centuries now. It was created based on the average value of the world's most commonly used currencies, and its exact value has been set in stone ever since. To avoid a worldwide market crash in case one economy would come to fall, its value is not dependent on any other of the world's currencies. This makes keeping track of its exchange rates in different currencies a bit harder to achieve, but ensures equity and limited protection against inflation. To give the reader an estimate of the univar's value, the UNI-to-USD exchange rate is <b>approximately 0.95</b> (which means 1á´œ is worth around $1.05).</p>
				
				<p class="content">When the Apeiron federation was officially created, its very own currency came along, called <b>infiar</b> (AUI, for <b>A</b>peiron <b>U</b>niversal <b>I</b>nfiar). It is further subdivided in 10 smaller units, known as the <b>octar</b>. Further subdivision in decimal values is possible but reserved to the stock market. The infiar is essentially a crypto-currency in the way that most of the currency's data are stored in electronic chips. The chip is then embedded in a support of the user's choice, most commonly a token or credit card, or directly embedded into one's dominant index finger. To ensure perfect economical stability, the infiar is valued to <b>a stable 1:1 ratio with the univar</b>.</p>
				
				<p class="content">For the reluctant ones, a few coins have been put into circulation. Those are simple token of steel, whose head is minted with their value, and tails with the company who minted the coins - which happens to be the <b><a href="minor/mgba.html" target='_parent'>Menthe&amp;Gyll Banking Administration</a></b> in 100% of the cases. The whole-value Infiar coins take on the shape of decagons of varying size, and the Octar coins take on the form of various polygons, triangles, quadrilaterals, of which the shape varies based on their value, in a scheme allowing to reconstitute the Infiar coin's decagonal shape by assembling various Octar coins like a puzzle.</p>
