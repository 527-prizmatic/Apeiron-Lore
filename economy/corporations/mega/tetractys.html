				<em>- Tetractys's slogan</em>
				
				<p class="content">As Apeiron's leader in the field of purely technological automata, and creator of many groundbreaking techs in the domains of robotics, artificial intelligence and transbioscience, <b>Tetractys Mechatronics Co.</b> is often revered as one of the most influent figures of the modern age. It is a very young corporation, and has not yet reached the status of multinational, which gives Apeiron a massive lead in the domain of technology, as the only nation on the planet with easy and unregulated access to cybertech augments.</p>
				
				<h3>History</h3>
				
				<p class="content">Tetractys Co. was born as the result of a demerger of <b>Mensana Transhuman Biotechs Inc.</b> After the initial successes of Mensana Corp.'s very first models of cybernetic enhancements, the company prolonged their partnerships with Infinium City's mechatronic laboratories for the conception of more simpilar products - until the year 182 PC, where the branch dedicated to cybertech conception eventually grew so large that the corporation deemed it large enough to be a separate company, and officially split its cybertech branch, which gained the status of subsidiary of Mensana Corp.</p>
				
				<p class="content">To simplify inter-company communication, the newborn subsidiary <b>made the acquisition of its partners</b>, after unanimous consent from the small companies' executives. With these new assets in its portfolio, the company started diversifying its activities, opening new branches dedicated to robotics and artificial intelligence, all while staying mainly focused on cybertech via their partnership with Mensana Corp.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Eventually, as they in fact held almost half the Federation's assets in terms of cybernetics and robotics, the small corporation steadily grew in influence, each of its three branches working in perfect coordination on all of their projects: the AI branch training neural models for product conception, the robotics branch providing new mechatronic solutions for the cybertech branch, and the cybertech branch feeding the other two thanks to the massive benefits made through the distribution of their revolutionary products. The corporation would eventually become completely independent from Mensana Corp., take on the name we all know today, and settle its permanent headquarters in Volnexar.</p>
				
				<h3>Activities</h3>
				
				<p class="content">Tetractys Mechatronics Co. is mostly known for having had a say in the conception of most cybertech available on the market. The corporation, however, is present in much more domains pertaining to mechatronics and robotics, ranging from industrial machineries and robots, to artificial intelligence and networking innovations. Beyond cybertech, one of their most famous realizations, known as <b>Vega</b>, is a small neural implant containing a powerful AI whose purpose is to serve the user as a virtual productivity assistant, with which it is possible to communicate via thought.</p>
				
				<p class="content">They work on four main domains, which are usually not considered to be branches due to the tight synergies between each of them. The corporation likes to call them "subblocks", as a nod to an integrated circuit's structure.</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li><b>Cybertech</b> - Conception, prototyping and production of cybernetic body enhancements</li>
					<li><b>Artificial Intelligence</b> - Research on large-scale AI models for all purposes</li>
					<li><b>Robotics</b> - Creation of automata of all kinds, whether for industrials or privates</li>
					<li><b>Network</b> - Datanet-dedicated research, security and overwatch</li>
