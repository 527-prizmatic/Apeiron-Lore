				<blockquote>The sky's no limit!</blockquote>
				<em>- Halkeiro Stellar Techs's slogan</em>
				
				<p class="content">Despite Aurasphere's much higher market value, it is commonly considered that the <b>Halkeiro group</b> is the largest corporation in the entire world, much larger than Aurasphere, in terms of fields of activity. Indeed, whereas Aurasphere is bound to technomagical electronics, Halkeiro has no specialization, and its four branches cover so many different areas that it is estimated that approximately half of Apeiron's basic functions heavily rely on Halkeiro's technologies.</p>
				
				<h3>History</h3>
				
				<p class="content">Halkeiro's history starts in the very early days of the Post-Heliostat era, as 85% of the desert city of Alkhasaar Almajid was blown up into ruins by a hailstorm of Heliostat debris. The city's spatio-ports, one of the planet's largest ones, was completely annihilated in the event. Seeking to bring back the taste of space exploration in people's minds after this cataclysm, a certain <b>Farid "Sirocco" Al-Alawi</b>, grandson of the space program's lead director, moved to a region near the North Pole to create his own space-faring company. His program received the name of <b>Operation Eclipse</b>, and quickly met an immense success, both financial and marketing. The company quickly expanded, along with the budding city its arrival gave birth to: <b><a href="../../../timeline/cataclysm/aurora.html" target='_parent'>Aurora Prime</a></b>.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The reason Halkeiro quickly sprouted so many branches is because they prefer to rely exclusively on their own knowledge of technologies to build and launch their spacecrafts, in order to ensure security, reliability and secrecy. This large variety of skills soon led to the space agency to sprout multiple branches in different domains and take over more and more areas of our life.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The corporation's name, Halkeiro, is a Planetary word meaning "cosmos, outer space". It later became a retroacronym standing for "<b>Hal</b>keiromi <b>K-ei</b>rimi <b>Ro'</b>ysmad", which roughly translates as "the World Bureau of Space".</p>
				
				<h3>Activities</h3>
				
				<p class="content">It would be nearly impossible to summarize Halkeiro's activities in a few words, due to their omnipresence in today's world. Instead, this section will simply detail the different activities of each of their subsidiaries.</p>
				
				<p class="content"><b>Halkeiro Stellar Techs Inc.</b> - The group's main branch, around which all the other ones revolve in some way. They handle anything related to space exploration and observation, including sending and monitoring satellites, coordinating observatories, and overseeing deep space mining operations. In addition, the corporation is among the leaders of the global effort towards the search of a new habitable world.</p>
				
				<p class="content"><b>Kevell Arsenal Company</b> - The company's military and armament branch handles conception and production of weaponry, armors and armored vehicles, for both personal and military use. Their principal customer is undoubtedly the AZN, for whom they regularly create ever-deadlier handheld weapons of mass destruction.</p>
				
				<p class="content"><b>Steamhall Motors Company</b> - This conglomerate of car manufacturers slowly came to absorb other vehicle brands to turn into an entity controlling 30% of Apeiron's automotive market. They handle a wide variety of small-to-medium vehicles, such as cars and vans, but also aerial vehicles. Among their iconic brands can be quoted the cheap but sturdy Prima, the vintage-styled aerials Electron, and the lavish sports brand Sayara.</p>
				
				<p class="content"><b>Plasmetal Chems Company</b> - This branch focuses on research onto new materials of any kind. This includes vehicle bodyworks, skyscraper construction, and even synthetic textiles. They are behind most of the exotic substances used in the construction of the Supernova.</p>
				
				<h3>A few famous realizations</h3>
				
				<p class="content">The corporation's largest space observation rig is located on <b><a href="../../../geography/wilderness/canopee.html" target='_parent'>Mount Canop√©e</a></b>. Their data is vital for the corporation's star maps and their search for habitable exoplanets.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The Kevell branch sustains a long-term partnership with <b><a href="aurasphere.html" target='_parent'>Aurasphere Corp.</a></b> for the development of the gamut of technomagical personal defense firearms known as the <b>WEAVER Series</b>.<p>
				
				<p class="content">Plasmetal's most famous creation is known as <b>KAR12</b>, an extraordinarily resistant carbon fiber made from tightly interwoven, nanomether-thin rods of highly pure carbon. It has a very large array of applications where extreme sturdiness is required, including but not limited to reinforcements for neo-concrete, armor plating, air vehicles, muscular cybertech augments, and much more.<p>
