				<em>- Aurasphere's slogan</em>
				
				<p class="content">Even though raw magic has largely fallen out of use within Apeiron, magically-powered components are commonly used in electronics to facilitate some functions that would be more expensive to replicate using electronics. Approximately 30% of all tech surrounding you is technomagical to some extent; of all this tech, nearly 99% of all patents and brands belong to a single corporation.</p>
				
				<h3>History</h3>
				
				<p class="content">The exact origin story of the <b>Aurasphere Corporation</b> is unknown by the public, as the corporation prizes the value of its history and only its highest-ranking employees are taught its secrets. Many theories circulate among the public. The most famous and widely accepted of these is that the company was officially founded in 1670 EA by a trio of engineers whose names are lost to the sands of time, as the spiritual continuity of an organization known as <b>Concilium</b>. The organization has been operating since the late Middle Ages, and worked in the world's then-most developed countries as supporters of ancient styles of magic, teaching its secrets to young students and spreading written texts about forgotten spells around the continent. The group fell into oblivion around the beginning of the 17th century EA, as recent industrial breakthroughs pushed technology so fast forward that magic had no hope to catch up.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Working on the base of Concilium, most of the newborn Aurasphere's creations embedded magical components and enhancers into mechanical devices - a branch of engineering that would come to be known as <b>technomagics</b>. Their art proved particularly effective and very cheap compared to its excellent performances, and thus quickly grew in importance, leading the company to hire many more engineers and designers - eventually even creating their own schools to train their future employees to technomagics engineering.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The corporation's activities skyrocketed by the 19th century EA, as their immense knowledge of technomagics was put to the test when they were asked to design a magical, inexhaustible, compact and modular power source for the OSS-Heliostat's shield modules. Among other things, this enabled them to gather enough funds to move their premises to Neo-Caryonite and found the city of <b><a href="../../../timeline/cataclysm/terminali.html" target='_parent'>Terminal One</a></b>.</p>
				
				<h3>Activities</h3>
				
				<p class="content">Aurasphere Corp. is comprised of <b>eight branches with various specializations</b>, all working towards the general same objective: conception, engineering, production of electro-technomagical technologies, and assistance to companies with similar goals. A company wishing to associate with Aurasphere for the creation of a new product will receive complete funding of the entire process and regular counseling from qualified experts. In exchange, the corporation receives a small tax on the sale of the new product, and if the concept is thought to have enough potential, the corporation allows itself to request co-ownership of the technology's patent, along with the original company. As of today, the entirety of the corporation's assets are valued at some 74	trillion Univar - a number which may seem enormous, but nothing too big for a corporation which virtually owns 30% of the planet's machines.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Each of the corporation's branches is specialized in a certain domain of activity, listed as follows. Due to similar domains of activity, a few of these branches work in extremely close collaboration with other mega-corporations.</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li><b>2HA</b> - Household appliances and home automation</li>
					<li><b>TBT-R</b> - Transbiotechnologies and robotics</li>
					<li><b>MQE</b> - Micro- and quantum electronics</li>
					<li><b>HEIT</b> - High-energy industrial technologies</li>
					<li><b>CNAI</b> - Computing, networking and artificial intelligence</li>
					<li><b>ALT</b> - Automotive, logistics and transportation</li>
					<li><b>PPES</b> - Power production and energy storage</li>
					<li><b>AAN</b> - Aero- and astronautics</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3>A few famous realizations</h3>
				
				<p class="content">Obviously enough, the corporation's most impressive feat was the foundation of <b>Infinium City</b>.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The corporation's PPES branch works in close partnership with Halkeiro's branch <b><a href="halkeiro.html" target='_parent'>Kevell Co.</a></b> for the development of the gamut of technomagical personal defense firearms known as the <b>WEAVER Series</b>.<p>
				
				<p class="content">The CNAI branch worked for a few years with <b><a href="../minor/mirabilia.html" target='_parent'>Modi Mirabilia</a></b> for the creation and marketing of their magic training program and the development of their electrocasting softwares.</p>
