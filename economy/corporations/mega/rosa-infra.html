				<em>- Rosa Infra's slogan</em>
				
				<p class="content">The history of <b>Rosa Infra WLLC</b> is a quite complex one, with some major twists and turns which led it to become what it is today: Apeiron's main company in the field of information and telecoms. Contrasting a lot with the federation's other mega-corporations, Rosa Infra is essentially a service company, providing telecom contracts, internet service, but also owns many different information media, including TV channels, paper-based and online newspapers, and radio broadcasts across a wide range of frequencies.</p>
				
				<h3>History</h3>
				
				<p class="content">The corporation has no official foundation date, as the entity known today as "Rosa Infra LLC" is in fact a monstrous conglomerate of numerous smaller companies having coalesced in a single economical entity. It is usually agreed that what is considered to be Rosa Infra's "primary" company, i.e. the largest and most influent one of the conglomerate, is a <b>research laboratory on radiocommunications</b> created in the late 18th century PC. Being born in the golden age of space conquest, the laboratory was quickly commissionned by the local space agencies for the development of new long-distance comm technologies for use in space vehicles.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The massive blow dealt to space exploration by the Heliostat's downfall instantly caused most space-oriented companies to either shut down or change their activities. Seeing as space conquest was no viable future anymore, the laboratory shifted into research over land-based communications, and <b>associated itself with a TV news company</b> for regular testing of their new technologies. Eventually, more and more companies joined the bandwagon, until the entity became less and less of a laboratory and more and more of a broadcasting company.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Rosa Infra chose to <b>move its headquarters to Terminal One</b> by the middle of the first century PC, as it was reckoned a large range of radiodiffusion services could be an invaluable asset for a growing megacity. The company would later start to provide its services to the entirety of Apeiron, and eventually to the entirety of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
				
				<h3>Activities</h3>
				
				<p class="content">Rosa Infra WLLC is a <b>highly modular company</b>, often believed to be legally invulnerable as its various services are connected too loosely to allow for the downfall of one entity to economically impact the other ones. The company <b>has no central authority</b> governing all of its subsidiaries; rather, each subsidiary is its own company, all legally interlinked together into a sort of corporate hive mind. The company's assets include <b>five international TV channels</b> received all around the Northern Hemisphere, <b>a large group of paper-based local newspapers</b> to the tune of one for each of the Northern Hemisphere's megacities, <b>an online news website</b> with an army of subdivisions for local news, and <b>eleven radio channels</b>, each covering a certain region of the world.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Among the most famous of their assets can be quoted:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li><b>Anova TV</b> - A rolling news TV channel covering the latest political news stories within Apeiron</li>
					<li><b>Galaxy News Radio</b> - A popular radio channel within Apeiron, alternating between political and celeb news, and all the latest music hits</li>
					<li><b>The Eye of Polaris</b> - Starcaller Prime's local newspapers, followed by space enthusiasts all around the world as an endless source of news about Halkeiro's conquests</li>
