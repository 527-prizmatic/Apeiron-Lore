				<em>- Modi Mirabilia's slogan, which translates in English as "One last spark of magic"</em>
				
				<p class="content">Firmly rooted in Infinium City's culture as being one of the last public organisms in Apeiron (and possibly even on K-e'anova) to promote the direct use of arcane magic over technomagics, Modi Mirabilia is a small company acting in a little variety of domains for the <b>promotion of the use of arcane arts</b>, training and mentoring of initiates, and designing technological means to assist people in the art. Both thanks to and despite the extreme rarity of practicioners and unpopularity of the art, they have become quite influent in the domain thanks to the total absence of rivals.</p>
				
				<h3>History</h3>
				
				<p class="content">Technology may be omnipresent, magic is not dead, and some people actively seek to revive it in a variety of ways. Modi Mirabilia started off in the very early days of Infinium City as <b>a training dojo of sorts</b>, for local mages to teach their art to younger initiates. The project was relatively frowned upon, as arcane arts were commonly seen as <b>very backward and practically primitive</b>, but it received a lot of praise in the community, as a uniquely original initiative.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Years later, Modi Mirabilia would start expanding their activities to the publication of various media related to magic and arcane, and used the funds collected from it to start developing their own family of technomagics, dedicated to <b>direct manipulation of the magic weave</b>, hoping to help reach more people thanks to tech-based products. This innovation would later become the core of their famous <b>Magic Spark program</b>, an initiative intended to provide an actual academic formation in arcane arts, backed up by technomagical means to help their students push through to success. It was argued that a specialization in true, raw magic could be an invaluable asset in most jobs centered around technomagics or making heavy use of them.</p>
				
				<h3>Activities</h3>
				
				<p class="content">Modi Mirabilia are a rather small company, as their domain of expertise is a quite restrained one; but for the same reason, they are the leaders in their domain. Their primary focus is the <b>re-democratization of magic as its own form of art</b>. They do so through a few different means, including but not limited to regular publication of works regarding magic and the science and physics behind it, conception of technomagical channels to amplify one's magic abilities, and research into new forms of technomagics.</p>
