				<blockquote>A clean slate for a clean future</blockquote>
				<em>- Satellis-Soltech's slogan</em>
				
				<p class="content"><b>Satellis-Soltech</b> was a R&D company based in Infinium City, subsidiary of the Nova Corporation, studying clean energies and their applications in many domains, but primarily focused on aerospace innovation. The company had quickly achieved fame by the late half of the third century PC thanks to its many breakthroughs in the domain, but collapsed shortly after a scandal accusing them of disinformation, violation of intellectual property and false advertising.</p>
				
				<h3>History</h3>
				
				<p class="content">The history of Satellis-Soltech was completely disclosed during the scandal revolving around them. The company was founded in the year 241 PC by a small research facility from Infinium City, who believed they had made <b>a revolutionary breakthrough in the domain of photovoltaics</b> and wanted to monetize their discovery. Almost immediately, the company came in very good standing among Apeiron's major figures, and enjoyed immense popularity, as their products proved incredibly efficient and cheap. This new form of energy became their primary product, and over the following years, the company worked on improving the technology and adapting it to different environments, including satellites, power plants, residential solar panels, and much more. Their focus on energies even led them to <b>become a long-term partner of the Nova Corporation</b>.</p>
				
				<p class="content">In the year 281 PC, just four years ago, as the company had landed a three-party contract with Aurasphere Corp. and Tetractys Co, a series of classified files were leaked online by a small hacktivist group known as <b><a href="../../../society/crime/neonmoon.html" target='_parent'>Neon Moon</a></b>. Directly stolen to the company's databases, the files contained many secret discussions between company personnel, suppliers and production lines, along with series of blueprints which revealed that not only their tech's production process was <b>particularly dangerous and harmful to the environment</b>, but also that most research data from the past ten years or so had been <b>stolen to the Halkeiro Group</b>. Immediately, the government ordered an investigation to be conducted, which confirmed what the leaked folders hinted at. Targeted by a Federation-wide storm of hate and threats from betrayed customers, and forced into compulsory liquidation by the Federation, Satellis-Soltech had no choice but close down by the end of the month.</p>
				
				<p class="content">It is unknown what happened of the company's executives, although rumor has it that the Halkeiro Group hired a trio of mercenaries to obliterate them (a process known as <span class="italics">kabooming</span> in Apeiron slang), as a reminder that nobody should ever dare mess around with the greats of this world.</p>
				
				<h3>Activities</h3>
				
				<p class="content">The boundary between what exactly the company actually created and what was stolen is still a bit uncertain. The company advertised its activities as <b>conception and production of cheap and eco-friendly solutions</b> for large-scale power production using solar energies. The company used to create their own technologies, but at some point the company's quickly growing influence led it to lose control of the situation, and as the laboratory <b>fell largely behind schedules</b> due to increasingly excessive demand for new products, the less scrupulous executives had to resort to rather unethical methods to keep their investors satisfied.</p>
