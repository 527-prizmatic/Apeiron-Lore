				<blockquote>Befriend him. Adopt him. Fuse with him.</blockquote>
				<em>- The Cube Company's slogan</em>
				
				<p class="content">The chain of themed novelty stores focused on cubic objects known as the <b>Cube Company</b> has achieved Federation-wide fame so quickly that some wonder if their success is purely due to their popularity, or something else. What is certain is, their name is quite famous within Apeiron, and although their products are quite the acquired taste, they're usually recognizable at first glance for their clever and exotic design. They have absolutely no influence in the technological domain or anything, they just sell little plastic and metal cubes.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The company is based in Infinium City, and was founded a mere ten years ago by a wacky couple of entrepreneurs wanting to "bring a bit of eccentricity to this sad world". The family-owned business runs a single factory in Mothership, where are produced <b>all sorts of everyday objects or decorations with unique designs</b>, integrating squares and cubes in place where they are the least expected, such as cubic glass bottles, mugs, rectangular frying pans, square keychains, and much more. Their mascot is a small cube with legs and arms, entirely white with not a single speck of color, wearing white gloves and white sneakers.</p>
