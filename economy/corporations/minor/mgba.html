				<em>- The M&amp;GB's slogan, which translates in English as "Securing our future"</em>
				
				<p class="content">The <b>Menthe&Gyll Banking Administration</b> (often shortened as <b>the M&amp;GB</b>) is Apeiron's federal bank company, and the Federation's normalization institute for most technologies regarding banking, finance and the economy in general. They do not design or produce any technologies themselves, but watch over the various companies providing the Federation with credit cards, contactless chips, and the like.</p>
				
				<h3>History</h3>
				
				<p class="content">The company was created in 149 PC as the fusion of the cities' various banking companies, just as Apeiron was in the process of coming together. At its creation, its main purpose was to stand as the Federation's face in international trading affairs, and they were immediately commissioned with the <b>unification of the four cities in a single financial entity</b>, to simplify trade and exchange between them. The solution they created bears the name of <a href="../currencies.html" target='_parent'>Infiar</a> and is now Apeiron's primary currency. The Infiar was at the time valued at a stable 1:1 with the Univar, and was designed to keep an absolutely constant value over the years to provide the Federation some protection against a worldwide market crash.</p>
				
				<h3>Activities</h3>
				
				<p class="content">As the brain behind Apeiron's entire economy, the company has a few missions. The first and most important one is to <b>be Apeiron's interface in international financial matters</b>; a mediator keeping track of every large-scale transaction between Apeiron and the rest of the world. This includes both company business and worldwide stock exchange; every company dabbling in international commerce must fill a monthly report of their benefits made through external commerce, and every single company share bought from the outside world must be registered.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Their second mission, just as important, is <b>supervision and validation of any product</b> created by outside companies and destined to the banking world. This includes physical currencies such as coins (which are minted by the M&amp;GB itself) and dedicated hardware, such as credit cards, subdermal chips, terminals and digital supports (produced by outside companies under the M&amp;GB's supervision).</p>
