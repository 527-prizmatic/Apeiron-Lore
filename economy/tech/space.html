				<p class="content">Once the nerve center of a small economical and industrial network scattered around the solar system, K-e'anova <b>closed most of its spatial borders following the Heliostat incident</b>, and its dominion over the local solar system quickly crumbled away. Nowadays, a small number of organizations around the planet are working in cooperation to restore this former empire, and maybe try to settle on another planet in case something cataclysmic happens once more to this one.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The first steps of space conquest trace back to as far as the second half of the 17th century EA, but it wasn't until 1780 EA that K-e'anova really started its efforts towards bending the other planets to its own will. The first target of this empire was the Moon, on which mining facilities were constructed to <b>extract precious resources from the satellite's ground</b>. The largest of these facilities, known as Selene Alpha, is an ilmenite mine and refinery doubled as a command center to coordinate the Moon's different mining operations, able to host 200 employees. The facility is still in operation today, despite how it stayed <b>cut off from Earth for nearly 14 years</b> after the Heliostat incident.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The Moon's mines and asteroid mining were crucial to the construction of the OSS-Heliostat, as K-e'anova's crust couldn't possibly have held enough resources. Ironically, the latter is also what caused their downfall, as when the Heliostat was annihilated, the resulting Kessler reaction <b>formed an impenetrable barrier around the planet</b>, which prevented most space operations from leaving or landing on K-e'anova for decades. The first company which managed to breach it was <a href="../corporations/mega/halkeiro.html" target='_parent'>the Halkeiro Group</a>; a feat which propelled them almost instantly to worldwide fame.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Nowadays, Apeiron is still the leader in the field, although other companies started budding around the world. Working in tight collaboration, orchestrated by the Halkeiro Group, this network has three primary goals: <b>restore</b> the world's artificial satellite network, <b>repopulate</b> off-world industrial facilities, and <b>search</b> for new places to colonize</b>. The world's largest spaceships can sustain up to fifty people for six months, and transport about 2,000 tons of cargo; they are propelled through space by <b>a combination of nuclear engines and ionic solar sails</b>, and are able to produce energy by feeding off the universe's abundant weave of infrared radiation, allowing to soar through space at the ludicrous top speed of <span class="unit" title="43.51 miles per second">70km/s</span> (which would be enough to reach the Moon in effectively just under two hours). For now, the planet's spatial empire is limited to its native solar system, but rumors say some companies are working on ways to travel to other stars.</p>
