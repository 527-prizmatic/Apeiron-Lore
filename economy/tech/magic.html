				<p class="content">In the ancient times, K-e'anova used to be a magically active world, shrouded in a powerful magic weave which was widely tapped into by man for all purposes. Thus, for a few centuries, the world stayed relatively behind in terms of technological progress compared to our real world, stuck in <b>a medieval-like era which lasted until around the year 1400 EA</b>. Obviously, development was not uniform all around the planet, and some enclaves of science were much more technologically advanced than the rest of the world. Around the beginning of the 14th century EA, one of these enclaves, a small equatorial, insular nation known as the <b>Khall Moons</b>, eventually set out in a quest of showing their wonders of science to the world, sparking a worldwide movement of progress which would quickly spiral out of control and give rise to a relatively early industrial age.</p>
				
				<p class="content">In the wake of this furious industrialization was born a guild of mages known as <b>Concilium</b>, which viewed this new industry as a scourge capable of destroying mankind as we know it; as such they strove to <b>spread the word of magic, in an attempt to preserve and revive the art</b>. The guild managed to stay afloat for about two centuries, but eventually, seeing themselves overwhelmed by technology, the guild disbanded and fell into oblivion almost immediately - save for a trio of engineers which took it upon themselves to further the guild's goals and would eventually found <b><a href="../corporations/mega/aurasphere.html" target='_parent'>the Aurasphere corporation.</a></b></p>
				
				<p class="content">Thanks to Aurasphere, magic experienced a new golden age, this time not as a competitor of industry but rather as a tool, a new form of energy, intangible but powerful, potentially harnessable just like electricity. Machines were widely adapted to implement magical reagents to improve and boost existing functions, giving rise to a new branch of engineering known today as <b>technomagics</b>. The art of technomagics evolved in perfect sync with the rest of technology, and eventually became an integral part of today's science.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Today, raw magic is almost never used as such anymore, but magical components are extensively used in modern-day electronics to emulate and enhance other components. Practicioners of ancient magic ("canes", as they are often called, a shortening of "arcanist") still exist, but are relatively rare, as most of magic's capabilities can be <b>easily and cheaply emulated with technology</b>. There are obviously some things electronics has not yet been able to replicate, but they are usually not deemed useful and common enough to need more people to go through the extensive training necessary to master them.</p>
