				<h1>Transbioscience</h1>
				<h2>Technological Breakthroughs</h2>

				<p class="content">The boundary between mechatronics and biotechnologies has always been thin. When the two eventually merged, the product got to be known as <b>transbioscience</b>; a rather blurry branch of robotics applied to biological automata (another fancy term for "animal"). Closely tied to cybernetics, it encompasses a wide variety of fields pertaining to repairing and enhancing the human body and its functions via mechatronic and electronic systems (known as <b>cybertech</b> or <b>cyberware</b>). The technologies are available to the public (at least to those who can afford it), and special variations exist for military purposes as well.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Implants <b>may only be installed by certified surgeons</b> (legally known as <b>transbiospecialists</b>, more colloquially as <b>metronics</b>), as the procedure is extremely invasive and requires lots of training to perform properly. As becoming a metronic requires flawless knowledge of a lot of disciplines at once, the formation is long and very demanding. A metronic's training consists in a ten-year academic curriculum intertwining robotics and surgery, which is provided in only one university in Apeiron, the <b>Federal Institute of Transbioscience</b>, conveniently located at the Supernova. As it is terribly difficult to achieve perfect training in all domains at once, metronics are usually specialized in only a handful of types of implants.</p>
				
				<h3>History</h3>
				
				<p class="content">The discipline has existed for centuries now, as artificial and mechanical prosthetics have been used since a very long time ago to restore lost motor functions. It is however commonly agreed that the modern definition of "transbioscience" came into being in the year 147 PC, in the wake of the MDS Invasion, as Mensana Corp. (then known as <b>Mensana Biotechnologies Co.</b>) signed a contract with Aurasphere Corp. for the development of electronic movement enhancers, destined to be used by the newly-trained soldiers. Field testing proved the technology was flawless, and as such was distributed to the entirety of the task forces.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Cybertech was in fact never meant to be distributed to the public, but as the news of the technology's success gave rise to a wave of enthusiasm for this new technology, the corporation decided to take advantage of this and developed a small gamut of basic implants destined to the public. As biology was progressing, transbioscience would quickly follow, and as the years passed, the technologies became increasingly complex, allowing for emulation, enhancement and upgrading of the human body's functions to almost unreal extents. Today, cybertech exists for everything, ranging from restoring a lost limb or sense, to enhancing one' motor or cognitive functions, and even add electronic interfaces for thought digitization and memory downloading.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Implants are extremely popular, although very expensive. Recent polls conducted throughout Apeiron indicate that <b>37% of the respondents</b> already owns at least one implant, and <b>another 54%</b> said to be planning to acquire one in the near future. Prices can range from 250 Infiar for a basic, generic muscular tonifier, to up to 25,000 for a state-of-the-art, high-quality sensory streaming chip.</p>
				
				<h3>Types of Implants</h3>
				
				<p class="content">Cybertech is broadly categorized in four "classes" based on functions and purpose.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The <b>I category</b> (for <span class="italics"><b>i</b>nt-agi</span>, "body" in Planetary) contains implants destined to enhance one's pre-existing motor functions and physical limits. This category includes but is not limited to skeletal reinforcements, reflex enhancers and subdermal armor plating. This class also includes combat implants, although those are rarely mentioned as heavily regulated.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The <b>K category</b> (for <span class="italics"><b>k</b>erea</span>, "brain" in Planetary) encompasses implants which aim at enhancing sensory and cognitive functions. This category includes but is not limited to bionic eyes, knowledge dictionaries, and other cerebral implants.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The <b>E category</b> (for <span class="italics"><b>e</b>reks-alkero</span>, "cyberspace" in Planetary) represents technology providing with a way to store, exchange and transfer data with the outside world. It occasionally overlaps with the K category, as it includes, but is not limited to neuro-Internet interfaces, subdermal bank chips, datachip readers, and other similar devices allowing to transfer in either direction any sort of data with a computer. They are usually very invasive, a bit risky to install, and require a lot of care.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The <b>V category</b> (for <span class="italics"><b>v</b>ald-ana</span>, "regeneration" in Planetary) stands for implants destined to restore or enhance metabolic functions vital to the body's proper operation, such as circulatory system accelerators, immuno-boosters, encephalic pacemakers, and other life-sustaining devices destined to assist a weakened organ in its proper operation.</p>
				
				<p class="content">A fifth class is sometimes brought up, but officially does not exist as it is not considered "true" transbioscience. The <b>M category</b> (for <span class="italics"><b>m</b>ek-eÄ«o</span>, "aesthetics" in Planetary) is made of implants which do not have a specific function and are used for solely aesthetic purposes. This category does not appear in any legal text, as it is legally classified as body art.</p>
