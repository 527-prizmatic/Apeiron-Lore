				<em>- A quite old ad slogan for Karbonaton's products</em>
			
				<p class="content">As about three quarters of Apeiron's mainland is completely unsuitable to most forms of traditional agriculture, the Federation's food industry heavily relies on rather unconventional processes, such as genetic modifications and artificial foods. Entirely orchestrated by Mensana Corp., this battery of processes allows for a much more intensive food production to be able to feed the entirety of the continent's population - to the detriment of quality, unfortunately.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Genetically-modified organisms have been around for four centuries now, but as man started to settle on Neo-Caryonite, new forms of agriculture would have to be quickly thought out to ensure everyone can be fed, despite the unhospitable climates. As such, <b>genetic modifications and diastrophin</b> were intensively used to quickly develop new species of cultivable plants that would survive the island's harsh, cold climates. The crop which proved most successful is a strain of barley known as "rimegrain", and it is still widely cultivated today, although very rarely used as a whole. A lot of other cereals were quickly abandoned as they proved too difficult to work with.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Meats are a bit difficult to come across since a lot of animals are simply unable to survive in such climates (and polar bear meat has proven to be an acquired taste), although some specially-prepared greenhouses are able to sustain farming. The most common meat to come across is chicken, as the animal grows up quickly and reproduces rather fast for its size. The animals are mostly fed with natural foods, comprised of carefully selected blends of grain and vegetables, often spiced up with a bit of chemical growth hormones (the latter of which is commonly regarded as severely unethical, but against which no action is taken, as it is deemed necessary to keep the market supplied amid high demands).</p>
				
				<p class="content">To overcome the scarcity of natural foods, science has devised a set of industrial processes allowing to produce edibles out of basic ingredients and a touch of biochemistry. The process simply consists in artificially adding nutrients and flavors to a simple industrial batter base made of water, soybean oil, and rimegrain flour (legally known as a <b>nutrient slurry</b>, more pejoratively as <b>corium</b>), which is then baked into various foodstuffs. The most common products synthesized from these slurries are <b>cookies, breads, snacks (both sweet and salty) and energy bars</b>, although science has managed to emulate an impressive varieties of substances; some special processes even allow to <b>obtain meat-like products</b>. These products are usually a bit bland, although very nutritious, can be nibbled at on the go, and particularly cheap. The most iconic brand for these products has to be <b>Karbonaton</b>, which specializes in hardtack, breakfast snacks and protein bars.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Most soft drinks are produced in similar fashions, through a clever combination of flavors, fancy colors, and unholy amounts of sucrose to get the consumer addicted as fast as possible. Alcoholic drinks are still produced the old-fashioned way, as science has so far proven unable to emulate the perfect combination of flavors of a Crimson Coast red wine (the one c√©page to rule them all, of worldwide renown), although most bars always have a keg of pure ethanol at the ready if someone wants to add some extra oomph to their Neojuice.</p>
