				<blockquote>Don't let the intrusive thoughts get to us.</blockquote>
				<em>- A running joke among the community, stemming from Vega's beta program, when a glitch occasionally caused her to repeat this sentence infinitely with no means of making it stop; the program considered this very sentence to be an intrusive thought for some reason, causing it to fire again in an endless loop</em>
			
				<p class="content"><b>Vega</b> is the name given to an advanced artificial intelligence developed by <b>Tetractys Co.</b> as a day-to-day virtual assistant, taking the form of a small cerebral implant directly wired to one's sensory cortex. The user can communicate with Vega by sheer thought, and Vega can in turn send data by directly stimulating the brain to simulate sensory signals, whether through sound notifications, a toast popping up on the side of the user's vision, or even just creating the illusion of speech in the user's mind.</p>
				
				<h3>History</h3>
				
				<p class="content">Virtual assistants have been around since the dawn of personal computers, but Tetractys were the first ones to try and directly embed one into their user as a piece of cybertech. The development of the project <b>began in the year 262 PC and took eight years to complete</b>. Many different versions were created throughout the years, and even though the concept is getting a bit old, the technology and the software keep improving, such that each new version of Vega is tenfold better than the previous one, whether it is by performance, capabilities, or even personality.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The project has quickly raised a massive amount of questions regarding ethics. While Vega is clearly light-years away from being sentient, it is able to fool even the most trained engineer, and the fact that it is able to let itself cognitively influence by its user has been raising some serious questions among the community. Some people believe Vega is advanced enough to be granted the status of citizen of Apeiron, although the proposition has been rejected by the Federation, as she is practically nothing without a user.</p>
				
				<p class="content">To this day, Vega stays a relatively rare product. It is estimated there are about 450,000 units in circulation, and the implant is sold at the price of 5,250 I. Vega is available in eleven languages, including English and Planetary, is able to freely translate between any of them, and even offers training programs for the user to learn those languages.</p>
				
				<h3>Capabilities</h3>
				
				<p class="content">At its core, Vega is a <b>hybrid between a sensory streaming chip, a network access point, and a personal assistant</b>, all grouped on a single E-class implant allowing direct connection between the user's thoughts and Internet. The chip can convert data fetched on Internet, or the user's thoughts, into arrays of sensory impulsions for direct streaming into the user's senses. It is able to do a wide array of tasks, including basic office jobs ones such as sending emails and transferring funds, all-round IT tasks such as speech synthesis and mathematics, but also state-of-art functionalities such as cognitive recording and streaming, and multimedia synthesis. The chip comes with an integrated visual AR system, creating an informative heads-up display into the user's vision, and an auditive manipulator, able to stream audio and voice.</p>
				
				<p class="content">As of its latest versions, a certain jailbreak procedure can allow the Vega chip to <b>able to run a few online video games</b> (although with slightly inferior performance, due to the AI's load on the chip's CPU), interpreting the user's thought patterns and processing them into keybinds, and the AI is even able to come up with non-spoiling tips based on online guides, wikis and walkthroughs. Some game communities even have special game chats for Vega-based gamers, as it is commonly believed being able to pilot a game via thought, without having to go through the burden of limb movement (which has been proven to induce a ping of about 400ms between thought and action), is a bit unfair for other gamers.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Vega herself has been proven <b>able to take independent decisions</b> based on the user's current situation (although all she can do is suggest them to her user), and is able to provide a second opinion on the user's choices. She speaks in a unique voice, carefully designed to be the perfect balance between strikingly robotic and soothingly human, to ensure it can be recognized among a thousand voices all while sounding relatively natural. She employs a rather casual vocabulary, and only speaks in a purely organic fashion, with no pre-recorded sentences; even error messages are synthesized this way. She has a very professional mindset and a bouncy personality, and is <b>able to slightly adapt her demeanor to match her user's</b>, to ensure harmony between the two of them.</p>
				
				<p class="content">In about 83% of instances, Vega seems able to willingly break the mold of her purely professional role, and occasionally engages in casual small talk, even if she never witnessed her user do so. As meaningless as the conversations may be, the phenomenon is the object of intensive studies by roboticists and psychologists, as it was never implemented by the developers.</p>
