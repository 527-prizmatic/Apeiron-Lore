				<p class="content"><a href="diastrophin.html">Diastrophin's unquestioned success</a> led the laboratory it originated from to quickly expand and order that <b>a small industrial complex would be built around it</b> in order to enable mass-production of the gene-altering nanite. It was all supposed to stop there - an industrial complex - but it was without considering man's sick curiosity.</p>
				
				<p class="content">By the beginning of the 20th century, everyone on K-e'anova had heard at least once of the odd animals prowling around in the northern expanses, constantly evolving and being internally hacked apart by diastrophin. And very quickly, those northern expanses ended up becoming tourist destinations, as people started <b>rushing in mass to the region</b> to witness the spectacle of diastrophin's works. This affluence of tourists may be a serious obstacle to proper research, their extremely deep pockets quickly convinced the industrials of the opposite. Attractions and tourist traps were rapidly built in the vicinity of the complex to harness this inexhaustible source of cash. The complex's company accomodation also <b>expanded to start receiving citizens</b>, as people slowly grew accustomed to the area, and the industrial complex ended up turning into a small community of researchers, industrials, biologists, but also curious civilians and sightseers seeking for a change of pace.</p>
				
				<p class="content">By the year 1935 EA, this community had grown to an impressive 22,000 inhabitants, enough to be officially considered a city, and received an official name: <b>Zandara-4</b>. The name was picked in conformity with city naming conventions, which state that if a city was founded thanks to the action of a corporation, the new city would receive the name of the corporation's home city, along with a unique number, generally in ascending order. As for the original laboratory, its immense success led it to become a bustling bioscience company, which, financially fueled by the newborn city, would quickly become the colossus known today as <b><a href="../../economy/corporations/mega/mensana.html" target='_parent'>Mensana Transhuman Biotechs</a></b>.</p>
