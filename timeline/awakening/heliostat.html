				<p class="content">The <b>OSS-Heliostat</b> (short for HelioStationary Orbital Solar Shields, colloquially known as the Heliostat) is the name under which was known a colossal, planet-scale project designed to <b>leverage the effects of global warming</b>. The project consisted in massive reflective shields placed in orbit around the planet, intended to reflect the Sun's light and reduce the warming effect caused by greenhouse effect, at least enough to slow the warming process to a halt.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The project was at first very critically received, as believed it would be a disastrous waste of time, money and resources. However, extensive support from <a href="../../economy/corporations/mega/aurasphere.html" target='_parent'>Aurasphere Corp.</a>, both via funding and media campaigns, led the project to be finally approved by all of the world's governments and initiated by the end of the year 1848 EA.</p>
				
				<p class="content">As K-e'anova's underground would likely be unable to provide sufficient resources for the entirety of the project, <a href="../../economy/tech/space.html" target='_parent'>deep-space mining operations</a> were launched, sending manned ships all around the solar system to bring back, dismantle and excavate asteroids and planetoids. All of the world's factories turned to the production of the necessary components, and over the course of twenty-three years, every single one of the Heliostat's eleven modules were slowly built. The project was herculean, as a structure this large would need to be assembled directly in orbit, but eventually, <b>the construction was completed without major incident</b>.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The Heliostat consisted in eleven thin and lightweight shields of aluminum, varnished in white to drastically increase its albedo. Each shield hovered some <span class="unit" title="1,860 miles">3,000 kilometers</span> above K-e'anova in a heliosynchronous orbit, so the shields would always directly face the Sun and protect the planet from its radiations at noon, when they would be the most intense. The shields were fully autonomous and kept in orbit by the help of ionic sails and ion thrusters, and disposed of their own power grids via solar panels.</p>
