				<p class="content">In the year 1888 EA, the alarm was raised over concerns that the planet's wildlife would be unable to survive the upcoming climate crisis caused by the Heliostat's unexpected success. In a global effort to help wildlife thrive in the new environments, a council of bioscience experts was gathered, tasked with finding a solution to this crisis. Many different options were considered, simple and peaceful ones such as relocation or reintroduction, but also complex projects such as simply letting them die out, or artificially forcing adaptation. The option that was finally considered is the last one.</p>
				<p class="content">To be constantly as close as possible from the imperilled environments, laboratories were set up in various northern areas of the globe, to develop a way to help wildlife survive, adapt and overcome all while closely monitoring the area. The best product to have been given birth in these laboratories is now known under the brand name <b>diastrophin</b>.</p>
				
				<p class="content">This peculiar organic nanite, constituted of three interwoven proteins, has the ability to infiltrate cells and "monitor" environmental conditions through various types of chemical reactions with intracellular substances whose presence and temperature help determine the animal's direct environment. The nanite also has the ability to interact with DNA-polymerase to edit the animal's DNA in accordance with the identified environment during cellular duplication, hoping to induce a mutation which could possibly help the animal or its offspring to thrive better in its new environment. The molecule is incapable of self-replication due to its intricate and unstable folding, but this issue would later be countered by the diffusion of large amounts of it into the atmosphere near endangered ecosystems.</p>
				
				<p class="content">This project has been extensively frowned upon due to its particularly invasive and aggressive method of operation, and it was quickly found out that while the process gives rise to interesting new features in about 40% of cases, a separate 20% of test subjects quickly developed violent cancers and destructive genetic diseases. Nonetheless, diastrophin has overall proved effective in most of the sample populations, and as such was deemed a complete success. The laboratory where the molecule originated quickly expanded and grew into a little industrial complex to allow for mass-production of diastrophin - an industrial complex which later received the name of Zandara-4.</p>
