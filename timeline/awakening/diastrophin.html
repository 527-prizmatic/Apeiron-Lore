				<p class="content">In the year 1888 EA, the alarm was raised over concerns that the planet's wildlife would be unable to survive the upcoming climate crisis caused by the Heliostat's unexpected success. In a global effort to help wildlife thrive in the new environments, <b>a council of bioscience experts was gathered</b>, tasked with finding a solution to this crisis. Many different options were considered, simple and peaceful ones such as relocation or reintroduction, but also complex projects such as simply letting them die out, or artificially forcing adaptation. The option that was finally considered is the last one.</p>
				
				<p class="content">To be constantly as close as possible from the imperilled environments, laboratories were set up in various northern areas of the globe, to develop a way to help wildlife survive, adapt and overcome all while closely monitoring the area. The best product to have been given birth in these laboratories is now known under the brand name <b><a href="../../geography/wilderness/diastrophin.html" target='_parent'>diastrophin</a></b>. It basically consists of a large multipart protein able to "monitor" the animal's environment and alter its DNA consequently in hope to induce a massive mutation that will eventually help the animal evolve to its new climates much faster.</p>
				
				<p class="content">This project has been extensively frowned upon due to its particularly invasive and aggressive method of operation, and it was quickly found out that while the process gives rise to <b>interesting new features in about 40% of cases</b>, a separate 20% of test subjects quickly developed violent cancers and destructive genetic diseases. Nonetheless, diastrophin has overall proved effective in most of the sample populations, and as such was <b>deemed a complete success</b>. The laboratory where the molecule originated quickly expanded and grew into a little industrial complex to allow for mass-production of diastrophin - an industrial complex which later received the name of <a href="zandara.html" target='_parent'>Zandara-4</a>.</p>
