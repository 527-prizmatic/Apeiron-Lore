				<p class="content">The exact reason behind it is unknown, but a critical mistake was made in the conception of the <a href="heliostat.html">OSS-Heliostat</a>. The solar shields proved much more effective than expected over long periods of time, causing the planet's warming not only to slow and stop but in fact reverse in less than ten years of operation.</p>
				
				<p class="content">This phenomenon was initially acclaimed worldwide, and with global warming considered solved, the world moved onto other matters. But when in the year 1880 EA, the world reached <b>the bar of a <span class="unit" title="3.5°F">2°C</span> drop</b> in average temperatures since the construction of the Heliostat, the situation was deemed problematic, and measures were immediately taken, to try and weaken the shields' effect.</p>
				
				<p class="content">By the year 1900 EA, the polar ice floes had expanded up to the 65th parallels on both hemispheres, triggering a mass exodus from the now frozen regions, to the equator's more clement weathers. This situation raised the concern of ecosystems, as many animals saw their environments ravaged by the drop in temperature. Would wildlife survive further cooling? Could humanity help in any way?</p>
