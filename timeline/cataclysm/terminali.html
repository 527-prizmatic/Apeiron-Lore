				<p class="content">While the Heliostat has been a disaster on the social and environmental sides, it triggered an unprecedented gold age for economics.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Having been backed up and funded by the world's most influent companies, the Heliostat has been a colossal marketing stunt for those companies... at least, the ones who did not get annihilated in the Heliostat's downfall. Among the ones who thrived thanks to this can be quoted the almighty <a href="../../economy/corporations/mega/aurasphere.html" target='_parent'>Aurasphere Corp.</a></p>
				
				<p class="content">With the Heliostat gone for good, everyone knew the planet would eventually start heating up again. In anticipation of a further expansion, and seeking to regain the public's trust through a new marketing stunt, Aurasphere's executives decided to implant their future premises in an isolated region near the poles. The idea was that the cold environment would help the corporation reduce its energy needs, as cooling down a data center is very energy-intensive. The exact location chosen was an isolated double fjord deemed ideal for the construction of a dam, in a region neighboring Zandara-4, hoping that an agreement could be found to share a power grid between the two places.</p>
				
				<p class="content">An agreement was quickly found. Zandara-4's workforce was commissioned to assist in laying down the foundation of Aurasphere's new premises, along with all the amenities and power sources this would require. Only a few years were necessary to build a fully functional settlement near the fjord, which was now harnessed by a hydroelectric power plant; the settlement was similarly structured to Zandara-4, with Aurasphere's new premises west of a small town, built to host two thousand people.</p>
				
				<p class="content">And similarly to Zandara-4's sudden development, the new settlement had to quickly expand, thanks to its unexpected popularity. Indeed, civilians arrived en masse for touristic, then residential reasons, as the environment (think about it, an almost untouched polar landscape near a beautiful fjord, and full of animal curiosities...!) proved itself to be particularly attractive.</p>
				
				<p class="content">In a surge of originality, Aurasphere Corp. decided to set aside the city naming convention, and reject the name of Kyamastar-3. Convinced that this budding city could be the starting point of something huge, they decided to start their very own branch in the tree of name series, and go for the name of <b>Terminal-1</b>. Their wildest dreams were quickly fulfilled, as the city would need a mere fifty years to become the mighty <b><a href="../../geography/cities/infinium.html" target='_parent'>Infinium City</a></b>.</p>
