				<h1>The Diastrophin Crisis</h1>

				<p class="content">On the year 2 PC, a critical incident in a <a href="../awakening/diastrophin.html" target='_parent'>diastrophin</a> plant led to the total obliteration of the facility. By some miracle, nobody died in the incident, but the workers' health was carefully monitored to ensure nobody had been contaminated by any substances. Careful medical studies were conducted and showed the presence in their organism of extremely high amounts of diastrophin. With their own accord and that of their families, the workers were invited to <b>stay at the laboratories and have their health put on watch</b> over the course of five years to look for any consequences of this contamination over their organism.</p>
				
				<p class="content">After two weeks, three of the subjects started <b>displaying signs of some neurologic affliction</b>, affected by a certain loss of coordination over their movements. This was quickly dismissed as a simple lack of exercise, but quickly the affliction appeared in many more of the subjects, which caused the laboratories to conduct a short study about it.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The presence of <a href="../../geography/wilderness/diastrophin.html" target='_parent'>a new, unknown substance</a> was quickly found in most of the subjects, located almost exclusively in the brain's glial cells. The substance displayed a very strong similarity with diastrophin in terms of both structure and chemical composition, but with a few major differences in folding, which made it <b>operate in a much more harmful and destructive fashion</b>, eventually necrotizing brain tissue and causing all sorts of neural impairments. A battery of tests proved that the substance only seems to form above certain concentrations of diastrophin, but no animals were immune to it. Research indicated the prion had already been implied in several unexplained deaths by the past, notably in the vicinity of the different plants across the world.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The announcement of this discovery immediately triggered <b>a planet-wide ban on all production of diastrophin</b> to ensure no accidental contaminations happen, and a planet-wide control was imposed on all wildlife to monitor the evolution of the condition of the most affected animals. The prion would later take on the name <b>MDS-5</b>, as a nod to the major differences in its configuration compared to diastrophin.</p>
