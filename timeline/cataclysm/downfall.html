				<p class="content">The year 1948 EA marks a critical step in the history of K-e'anova; it was in fact so critical that it marked the end of the <a href="../awakening.html" target='_parent'>Era of Awakening</a> and the beginning of the <a href="../posthelio.html" target='_parent'>Post-Heliostat Era</a>.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Following catastrophic drops in average worldwide temperature due to the <a href="heliostat.html">OSS-Heliostat</a>'s unexpected performances, numerous councils of both governmental and scientific institutions were held across the planet to discuss a way to disable the Heliostat or at least weaken its effects. After eight months of deliberation, a final council established that trying to move the Heliostat over regions of the world where it would have less influence was out of the question due to the complexity of the task; it was then decided that the Heliostat would be taken down. However, the shields had not been engineered to be so easily removed from their orbits, as it wasn't expected that the need to remove them would ever arise; thus it would be necessary to purely and simply destroy them using equipment powerful enough to tear the shields apart as quickly as possible.</p>
				
				<p class="content">This method was massively decried as extremely dangerous by the entirety of the world's population, but was eventually forced through, as the climatic situation was deemed too urgent to be picky. Thus, the planet's entire thermonuclear arsenal deployed in bulk to rip apart the Heliostat to harmless shreds by the end of the year; an impressive total of 191 strikes were orchestrated, effectively turning the Heliostat to dust within four months. At least it was the plan, but it turned out to unfold quite differently.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Instead of neatly fragmenting in harmless shreds and disintegrating when falling into the atmosphere, some of the shields fractioned in dangerously large shards which fell onto the world's surface almost unscathed, wreaking absolute havoc through either falling into the ocean and causing planet-wide tsunamis, or simply falling on land with the destructive energy of a meteor. Over the course of three weeks, a frightening total of 37 world-class megacities were completely eradicated in the hailstorm of debris, accounting for almost 522 million deaths worldwide. The debris and dusts lifted by the impacts shrouded the world in a planet-scale sandstorm, plunging it in darkness for a total of two months. Those of the shards which stayed in orbit collided either with each other or satellites, almost immediately triggering a Kessler effect, cluttering the planet's exosphere with an impenetrable barrier of debris, and destroying the majority of satellites orbiting at those heights. A few shards somehow managed to stay operational and are still hovering in K-e'anova's skies, although those were deemed too small to have any noticeable effect and were simply put on a watch list.</p>
				
				<p class="content">By some stroke of luck, K-e'anova was mostly spared by radioactive fallout, but the chaos, confusion and fear for the future caused by the catastrophe was already enough of a problem. With the Heliostat gone and the world scarred for eternity, the Era of Awakening came to an end, and the year 1949 EA became the year 0 PC (Post-Cataclysm).</p>
