				<p class="content">As by a strange twist of fate, among the numerous megacities that were reduced to smoking ruins in <a href="downfall.html" target='_parent'>the fall of the Heliostat</a> was included Alkhasaar Almajid, home of the Najmalsabah Program, one of the planet's largest aerospace companies and the first one to have urged the world to build the Heliostat. Combined with the Kessler reaction, this event caused a long-lasting halt in the world's efforts towards space exploration, and the loss of most short-range communication satellites almost plunged the planet in a new dark age.</p>
				
				<p class="content">In the year 9 PC, a team of astrophysicists decided to rekindle the flame of space exploration. Led by the grandson of the last ex-CEO of the Najmalsabah Program, the team established a small laboratory to monitor the evolution of the debris clouds. In an urge of poetic symbolism, they decided to settle as close from the North Pole as possible, so that Polaris, the navigator's star, could always brighten their way upwards towards the skies. The selected location was a small mountainous islet lying by 86Â°N, the northernmost patch of solid land on the planet.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The laboratory established that through a complex ballet of forces and inertia, the clouds of debris seemed to have cleared up around the poles, and seemed to slowly gather towards the equator. Being offered such an opening was too good an opportunity not to be seized immediately; as such, the laboratory ordered that a small space port would be built on the island, and planned for the launch of a symbolic rocket towards the skies as a message to the world that hope is not gone forever. The announcement of the event was a thunderbolt among the community, and the project received immediate support from the whole world; if it succeeded, maybe there would be a way to replace the destroyed satellites, and maybe even send ships into the cosmos once more.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Everything was ready within ten months, and as the event was expected to gather a lot of people coming to assist to the symbolic launch, a few hotels had to be built in emergency to accomodate the visitors; the nearby airport that had been used for transportation of materials was adapted to receive travelers. A series of air vehicles were made ready to carry people to the closest city in case the makeshift housing would not be enough for all the guests.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The event blew up all expectations, as nearly ten thousand people made the trip to assist to the takeoff, and the event received media coverage impressive enough that almost three quarters of the world's media broadcasted the show live. This sudden rise in popularity was a golden occasion for the newly-created space agency, which expanded its activity to build and launch its own ships, and eventually volunteered to replace the entirety of the destroyed satellites. The makeshift town was eventually turned into an actual city, which took off and expanded extremely quickly; with all the eyes of the world drawn onto them, the space agency saw no concurrents arise, and as such held the monopoly of space exploration for long enough to become the world's leader in the domain in less than twenty years.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Despite having technically been founded through a corporation's activities, said corporation had been founded there, and as such the privilege of starting a new branch in the naming tree went to the space agency, who picked the name of <b>Aurora Prime</b> as a nod to their polar locations. Boosted by this worldwide popularity, the space agency evolved quickly into a massive corporation known today as <a href="../../economy/corporations/mega/halkeiro.html" target='_parent'>Halkeiro Stellar Techs Inc.</a></p>
