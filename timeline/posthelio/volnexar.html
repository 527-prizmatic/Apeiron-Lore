				<p class="content">The best way to keep something under control is to keep it contained somewhere, and to this purpose it would quickly become necessary to get the feral lifeforms restricted to a certain perimeter for further behavioral studies.</p>
				
				<p class="content">To this purpose, the small army gathered by Infinium City would be sent to the very east of the island, to find a suitable location for a new settlement on the only unexplored coast of the island. This new town would be mainly a research camp, inahbited mainly by biologists for their studies of the wildlife, the environment, and diastrophin's impact onto them.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Rather quickly, the local wildlife showed itself quite aggressive towards the newcomers, but being well-equipped and ready, this threat was easily dispatched by the camp's soldiers, letting the scientists work freely. The island's three cities being fully aware that the three of them were threatened by this, reinforcements and munitions were regularly sent, helping slowly turning the science camp into a real fortress. Eventually, this fortress would be joined by a few more residential buildings, so that the families of the soldiers could come as well.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The small settlement's constant growth, caused by the reinforcements, the families of the new soldiers, and the occasional civilian, quickly turned it into an actual town; and when in 146 PC the menace was officially considered warded off, the settlement gained the official status of city. Having not been created directly through a corporation's actions, the city got to choose its own name, and eventually came to be known as <b>Volnexar</b>.</p>
