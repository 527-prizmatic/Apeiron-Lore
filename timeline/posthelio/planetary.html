				<p class="content">The intense intercity collaboration required by Terminal One's reconstruction was only one of many events worldwide which required perfect collaboration and mutual understanding. Unfortunately, language barriers were still very strong and misunderstandings were commonplace.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Many attempts at finding linguistic compromises, common languages and ways of communicating without any ambiguities were made throughout the past two centuries, but most of them never took off, due to a lack of interest and a current focus of the world onto more pressing issues, such as the Heliostat. But now that the world saw everyone had to work hand in hand to stand up again, the need for a common speech was getting increasingly urgent. The <b>World Speech Foundation</b>, a small unit of linguists from all over the world, was founded in 47 PC, and immediately started working on their new language.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The first drafts of what would eventually become the Planetary language were created in 49 PC, as the newborn <b>Halkeiro space agency</b> announced a series of large-scale space cleaning projects which would require collaboration from the entire world. They were intended to be extremely simple to use, understand and speak, with the help of a ridiculously simplified grammar and very few exotic sounds. This language project was submitted to a few corporations around the world, which imposed its use for the month to come, to test if the language would be usable over the long term. It turned out it was unusually complex to master as most of its vocabulary became dangerously vague and ambiguous in a corporate context, and so the project returned on the linguists' desks.</p>
				
				<p class="content">A second draft was published in 53 PC. This one was much more complex than the previous one in terms of grammar, but stayed relatively simple on most other aspects, to give the language more structure while keeping its basic vocabulary. This version was found to be much more suitable for long-term use, and as such was kept by Halkeiro for its projects.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Over the years, the World Speech Foundation regularly published more and more versions of the new language, in a goal to keep it as structured as possible to rule out any and all misunderstandings, while expanding its vocabulary and sound inventory to help facilitate shortenings and abbreviations and shaving off the edges of complex structures to keep everything as short as possible. The modern version of Planetary was published in 71 PC and was universally passed as official secondary language by 94% of the world's governments. The language would eventually be named directly after its creators - <b>K-eimi Rekāri</b>, "the World's Language".</p>
