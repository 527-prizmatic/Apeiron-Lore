				<h2>The Post-Heliostat Era</h2>

			<div id="main">
				<p class="content">Of the different cities that emerged in the wake of the Post-Heliostat Era, none became so popular, so quickly, as the trio of the North Pole: <b>Aurora Prime</b>, <b>Zandara-4</b>, and <b>Terminal One</b>. Their prime locations in an almost untouched region of the world, the endless opportunities provided by the small cities thanks to the legions of companies that either moved or appeared there, and a worldwide compulsion to seek for a change of scenery after the annihilation of half the planet's megacities, caused the trio of cities to quickly become the number one destination to start a new life.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The less industrial-oriented and more quality of life-oriented Terminal One stood among the trio as the most agreeable of the three. Its twin Terminal Two was just as popular, as it had been built closer to the fjord's edge, allowing for a more direct access to the water for the development of a little harbor. By the end of the first century PC, the two cities were home to nearly 650,000 inhabitants.</p>
				
				<p class="content">As the current day's legislation ruled, any city of more than 25,000 inhabitants had to have a government of its own, thus Aurasphere Corp. needed to pass on the control of the two cities to legitimately elected mayors as soon as the year 40 PC. Convinced that a unique two-headed government could help coordinate the two cities' operations much better, Aurasphere suggested to the two cities to merge into a single legislation - a suggestion that most of the population agreed on, for the same reasons. Indeed, a few legal battles had already taken place for the ownership of some areas of land, such as the three small islands located in the fjord's estuary, which had been the center of a heated legal joust for twenty years already.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The merger was then submitted to competent authorities, which eventually accepted the fusion by the end of the year 108 PC. As modern naming conventions dictate, a city born from the fusion of two other ones gets to start a new branch of the naming tree, picked by whichever entity is governing it. Wishing for everyone to be happy with the new name, the new city's government organized a series of polls and votes to learn about the public's opinion. The name that was eventually chosen is the modern name of <b>Infinium City</b>.</p>
