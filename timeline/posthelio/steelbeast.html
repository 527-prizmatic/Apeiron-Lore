				<p class="content">The <b>Steelbeast Incident</b> is the name given to a catastrophic industrial disaster which ravaged half of Zandara-4.</p>
				
				<p class="content">In the year 248 PC, a <a href="../../economy/corporations/mega/mensana.html" target='_parent'>Mensana</a>-owned chemical plant was the theater of a critical accident which eventually led to the explosion of the entire facility. Factories which stood in the wake of the shockwave were annihilated, triggering a large chain reaction which eventually led to the <b>complete flattening of about 15% of Zandara-4's urban area</b>. The explosion lifted large amounts of rock and earth, excavating an impressive crater almost <span class="unit" title="0.25 mile">400 meters</span> across. An estimated 2,800 people died in the accident, 35,000 were injured, and 150,000 were left homeless. The shockwave was felt everywhere across Apeiron, and the sound of the blast was heard in Infinium City.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The exact cause of the incident is still unknown to this day, as nothing was left of the factory and no proper investigation could be conducted. The most widely accepted theory is a <b>gross negligence of safety measures</b> which led to the release of harmful and highly reactive substances. The hypothesis of a terrorist attack was considered as well, but it was eventually dismissed by lack of evidence.</p>
				
				<p class="content">What the investigation managed to pick up would eventually lead the entirety of Apeiron to sue Mensana Corp. once more. The corporation eventually engaged itself to fund the entirety of the repairs, and <b>put its chemical industry on an indefinite hold</b> for the time being. <a href="../../geography/cities/volnexar.html" target='_parent'>Volnexar</a> established a small plant to produce its own <a href="../../geography/wilderness/diastrophin.html" target='_parent'>diastrophin</a>, as it was found out through research for the <a href="vms.html" target='_parent'>VMS</a>'s armament that certain derivatives of diastrophin displayed regenerative properties when administered locally and in very low amounts.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Backed up by Mensana's financial support, who would eventually be joined by the entire federation's workforce, the city would eventually be rebuilt within fifteen years. People left homeless by the catastrophe were relocated to Apeiron's other cities for the time being, and could eventially reintegrate the new residences as they were being rebuilt. Being radically changed forever by the accident, <b>the city decided to symbolically advance its name by one increment</b> as a symbol of rebirth and renew, and take on the new name of <b>Zandara-5</b>.</p>
