				<p class="content">The tight solidarity displayed during the <a href="invasion.html" target='_parent'>MDS-5 incident</a> and the impressive economical benefits the three cities gained from it were seen as an evidence that some form of long-lasting partnership would be necessary to thrive.</p>
				
				<p class="content">In the year 147 PC, a council was held gathering the governments of <b>Infinium City</b>, <b>Starcaller Prime</b> and <b>Zandara-4</b>, and the leaders of the main corporations at the heart of the three citiescities, respectively Aurasphere Corp., the Halkeiro Group, and Mensana Inc. The goal of the reunion was to agree on a way to strengthen the three cities' relations, both economically and socially. It was considered that as the cities' official founders, the corporations were allowed to have a say in the matter.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The final decision was that the three cities would each be granted the title of city-state, and be defined a certain area within which the cities could freely expand. The rest of the island's territory would be shared among the three, which means any project of constructing something in the wild will require to be approved by all three cities. Each city would otherwise stay wholly independent, and no higher administration would be granted power over the three cities at once.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The budding <b>Volnexar</b> would join the union the following year. As the three main corporations of the island had given the world a new impulse and a new drive in this dark age, it was decided that the federation would be granted the name of <b>Apeiron</b> - a Planetary word for "infinity".</p>
