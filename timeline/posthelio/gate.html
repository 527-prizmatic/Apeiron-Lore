				<p class="content">The <b>Gate</b> (or in its full name <b>Apeiron's Gate to the Outer Space</b>) is the name under which is known a megastructure consisting in a large, circular platform of concrete approximately one mile in diameter, strategically built in the heart of the bay around which Aurora Prime was built. The megastructure hosts the headquarters of the <b><a href="../../economy/corporations/mega/halkeiro.html" target='_parent'>Halkeiro Group</a></b>, three spatio-ports, and an armada of factories owned by Halkeiro, dedicated to the construction of their spaceships.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The small spatio-port built by Aurora Prime's famous space-faring company had quickly become insufficient to fulfill the full needs of the company. Relying on external companies for construction of the satellites was too much of a hassle, that is why the company decided very early on to manufacture their own machines. But without a decent spatio-port to send them in space quickly enough, the company would quickly be drowned under the concurrence.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The project of the Gate was submitted to Aurora Prime's government in the year 104 PC, which immediately validated it; people loved the city due to its space program, it would be a shame to let them down. The first stone was laid the next month, and despite the monstrosity of the task at hand, the platform would eventually be completed in four years. Building all the required infrastructure to allow for rocket launches would be a trifle.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The Gate was inaugurated in the winter of the year 110 PC, and in the most outrageous fashion a corporation could come up with: with a spectacular display of cosmic fireworks. A trio of rockets would be launched to the planet's ionosphere, loaded with extremely powerful magnetic disruptors which would activate only in the higher altitudes. The show consisted in the devices interfering with the planet's magnetosphere in calculated fashions to create a dazzling show of artificial northern lights.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Seeing the Gate as a symbol of renew and of new hopes for the future, the city inspired itself from the spectacle to take on the new name of <b>Starcaller Prime</b>.</p>
