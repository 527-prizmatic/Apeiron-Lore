				<p class="content">Despite the immense amount of animal species roaming the Earth, it is fascinating to see how they all have a single, common goal: kill or be killed. When Zandara-4's diastrophin plants eventually reopened in the beginning of the 2nd century PC, the trio of cities discovered that the hard way.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The year 139 PC saw Infinium City suddenly submerged under a wave of feral wildlife, turned by diastrophin into ruthless, monstrous beasts. The event arrived as a hurricane, as military budgets had been gravely neglected in the past few decades; as such, the sudden need to form a rapid response corps united all of Infinium's population as a single mass against this unusual invader.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Primary studies by field biologists revealed that the attack happened as the local wildlife had almost exhausted its local sources of food and considered the three cities as new hunting and feeding grounds. Sightings of animals within the streets had already been reported as early as three months ago, but it was concluded that the wildlife quickly understood the cities were too powerful for an individual beast, and as such a larger pack assault would be required in order to win the fight.</p>
				
				<p class="content">As <b>Halkeiro</b>'s steelworks were so far the most developed precision factories on the continent, it was requested that the corporation helps supplying Infinium City with the needed arsenal to get rid of the issue, while the city itself would start recruiting soldiers on a voluntary basis. Zandara-4 immediately shut down all its diastrophin plants, and applied its various chemical plants and refineries to the production of chemical weapons. The three cities working in perfect coordination helped set up a functional corps of a thousand volunteers within two days. This makeshift century was immediately deployed to watch over Infinium City's streets and shoot any suspicious-looking animal on sight, while a larger army would be gathered to send a large-scale operation directly within the mainland to get rid of anything that could end up becoming a threat.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The green light was given a few days later, as an army of five thousand men started their march towards the east. Their goal was to monitor local wildlife and eradicate anything showing the slightest sign of aggressiveness. The whole operation was somewhat frowned upon by the population as being almost comparable to a genocide, but people kept a low profile as they knew it was for their own good.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Further studies, including autopsies of the dead beasts and studies of captured live specimens, showed that the rampaging beasts seemed to have an intellect much more developed than usual. This hyper-development was eventually blamed on the discovery of high amounts of MDS-5 in the creatures' brain matter. Such high amounts clearly implied a violation of health regulations, which ended in Infinium City and Starcaller Prime's governments suing Mensana Inc. over their lack of proper supervision; but the biochemistry corporation simply shrugged off the lawsuit by accepting to pay a monstrous fine cash.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Well beyond the concerns of future animal invasions, this incident revived a market which seemed nearly dead as of the last few decades, the market of firearms and of military investment. This would even cause the Halkeiro group to sprout a new branch focused in armament, known today as <b>Kevell Co.</b></p>
