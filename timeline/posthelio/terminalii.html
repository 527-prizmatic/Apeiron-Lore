				<p class="content">As <b>Terminal One</b> had started growing into an actual small city, drastic changes would have to be made, as the city's structure had not been planned to grow that large so fast.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Having been created thanks to the sole activities of a corporation, the small city was legally under full control of <a href="../../economy/corporations/mega/aurasphere.html" target='_parent'>Aurasphere Corp.</a>'s executives. But seeking to ensure the public is as much listened to as possible to avoid problems, a vote was organized in Terminal One to figure out what could be done to allow the city to expand further. It would eventually be decided that <b>part of the population of Terminal One would be temporarily relocated</b>, while the city would undergo drastic architectural changes to allow for a modular and more sustainable structure easily allowing further expansion. People who would be affected by the changes would be free to choose where they would like to be sent for the time being.</p>
				
				<p class="content"><b>Around six years were enough</b> for the workforce of the neighboring cities to quickly take down the outer quarter of Terminal One and rebuild more durable buildings over their foundations. Starting approximately at the same date, and over the course of thirty years, approximately <span class="unit" title="4.6miÂ²">12 square kilometers</span> of land surrounding the city were flattened and backfilled to allow for the city to expand further. The fjord's various branchings were considered as a hindrance for the city's expansion towards the southeast; as such it was projected to either backfill them or build platforms over them, to allow for further expansion.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The project started in the year 29 PC, although people would have to wait until 57 PC to finally admire the result. In this interval of time, the city continued growing, and since a time came where the city's reconstruction prevented to create new residential buildings, the opposite bank of the fjord saw the birth of a small micro-city, where families wanting to settle in Terminal One were temporarily redirected for the time being. By the end of the project, this micro-city had expanded to about half the current size of Terminal One, and would even receive its very own name of <b>Terminal Two</b>.</p>
