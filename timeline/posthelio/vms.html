				<em>- Commander Blackskull to a whiny soldier</em>
			
				<p class="content">By lack of external threats to contain, Volnexar's garrison slowly mutated into an elite force dedicated to protecting against threats from within.</p>
				
				<p class="content">With the four cities now united as the mighty <a href="apeiron.html" target='_parent'>Apeiron</a>, the four cities' economies quickly started skyrocketing, and were rapidly followed by massive increases in crime rates. Police forces were already patrolling the streets since the birth of the cities, but it was quickly understood they would be doomed to become insufficient due to the ever-increasing share technology was getting from the people's daily lives.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Directed by the iron fist of the current leader of Volnexar's garrison, a certain <b>Morgan "Blackskull" Johansson</b>, the city's armed forces exposed their project to the various governments of Apeiron, which unanimously accepted to back them up. As such, the Halkeiro Group repurposed some of its factories to the production of armament and vehicles, while Infinium City's mechatronic companies started working hand-in-hand with Mensana Inc.'s biological expertise in an attempt at creating the first cyborgs of the new age.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The <b>Volnexar Military Security</b> started its activities in the year 153 PC with about seven dozen men and women armed to the teeth ensuring security in Volnexar's streets, among which five volunteered to be equipped with Mensana's prototypes. Those new devices, the world's very first cybertech, were relatively simple in their conception, and consisted in simple impulse generators destined to amplify the brain's neural signals, to stimulate leg muscles and increate the soldiers' mobility despite their heavy armors. The prototypes proved both flawless and highly efficient, and as such all of the VMS's soldiers were quickly equipped with these implants.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The VMS's impressive performance quickly led them to expand, recruit more men, and create auxiliary bases all around Apeiron, with the goal to ensure the absolute security of each of the four cities. Eventually, they would get to be known as the <b>AZN</b>. Mensana Inc. would eventually make of the cybertech industry one of its main activities, which caused the corporation to rename itself as <b>Mensana Transhuman Biotechs Inc.</b></p>
