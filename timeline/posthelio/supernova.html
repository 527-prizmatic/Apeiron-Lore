				<p class="content">The <b>Supernova</b> is the name of a huge megastructure dominating the center of Apeiron's mainland, comprised of a large scientific and academic campus dedicated to R&D in theoretical, quantum and particle physics, built around a monstrous thermonuclear fusion power plant providing energy to a quarter of Apeiron's population.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Apeiron's demographic boom would quickly make most energy sources insufficient to properly sustain the entirety of the Federation. It is towards this purpose that in the year 198 PC, the <a href="../../economy/corporations/mega/novacorp.html" target='_parent'>Nova Corporation</a> submitted the project to the Federation's mayoral council. The project was ambitious and dangerous, as so far thermonuclear fusion had only been mastered at small scales; nonetheless, the project was <b>approved unanimously</b>, as incurring the risk of energy shortages might be dangerous for some regions of the island. Press conferences were held by the corporation to expose their project to the population, during which Novacorp's research teams demonstrated many times that such a realization would be possible and sustainable.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The first stone of the power plant was laid in 202 PC. Thanks to the invaluable help of the <a href="../../economy/corporations/mega/halkeiro.html" target='_parent'>Halkeiro Group</a> for supplying construction materials, along with Plasmetal's work to produce the extreme materials required for the tokamak, the construction of the power plant took only a few years; and it was in 221 PC that the power plant was inaugurated, in a public ceremony which gathered almost twenty thousand people.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Quickly the space surrounding the power plant would see the creation of various research complexes and technical schools, studying the most cutting-edge fields of research such as quantum electronics, transbioscience and astrotechnologies. Among the most notable of its features can be quoted the ambitious <b>ARPEGGIO</b>, a large-scale particle accelerator for exploration and studies of matter at the quantum scale, running for almost <span class="unit" title="37.2 miles">60 kilometers</span> under the surface of the Supernova.</p>
