				<p class="content">Approximately 80% of Apeiron's <b>127 million inhabitants</b> are concentrated in its four main cities, while the rest is scattered around the island, into small cities and residential complexes located here and there along the island's transcontinental highways. This series of articles will mainly focus around the federation's four major cities, along with the Supernova.</p>
				
				<p class="content"><b>DISCLAIMER - So far my worldbuilding efforts were massively focused onto Infinium City, and as a result the other cities have almost little to no content, which is why I won't be making an entry for them for now. Maybe I'll get onto that as the game advances and we find ourselves in need of some worldbuilding for the other regions of Apeiron as well.</b></p>
