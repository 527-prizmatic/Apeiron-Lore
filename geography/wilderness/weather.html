				<p class="content">With the planet's climate seriously disturbed by the Heliostat, and man's industry adding a new layer of artificial constraints on the environment, many natural phenomena were completely turned upside-down over time. The water cycle is no exception, and a new variety of interesting weather conditions occasionally take place on Apeiron.</p>
				
				<p class="content"><b>Carbon smogs</b> are a family of clouds charged with air pollution. They hover very low in the sky, most often one or two hundred feet above ground level, but they can occasionally reach down to the ground. They are usually not considered a problem in the wilds, but they can quickly become dangerous in the cities, as they are loaded with industrial toxins and are generally very noxious to breathe over the mid- to long-term. They are usually most common in the spring, as all the pollution trapped in frozen waters are released upon thawing.</p>
				
				<p class="content"><b>Acid rains</b> are the water-based manifestation of the same phenomenon, resulting from the contamination of oceaic water, which then ends up in the rest of the water cycle. While clear, unpolluted rainwater has a pH of 5.7, the term of acid rain is used by the Federation for rainwater with a pH below 5. Approximately half of all rain events happening on Apeiron are classified as acid, and it is usually advised not to go out bare-headed during these events, as acid rains are capable of causing mild surface burns to exposed skin over the long term.</p>
