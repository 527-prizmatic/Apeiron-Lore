				<p class="content">The western coast of Neo-Caryonite is lined with high, steep cliffs and rugged coastlines. In the island's northern expanses, where the coast runs along <b><a href="canopee.html" target='_parent'>the mountains</a></b>, can be found an impressive collection of fjords and glaciers.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Being completely located above the 80th parallel, the region known as the <b>Kelvin Glaciers</b> received its name from the extreme colds keeping the mountains in a perpetually frozen state.  Its temperatures usually oscillate between <span class="unit" title="14°F">-10°C</span> and <span class="unit" title="-50°F">-45°C</span> based on the time of the year, and the coldest ever recorded reached <span class="unit" title="-71°F">-57.2°C</span>. Despite the extreme dangerosity of its steep, frozen mountainous terrain, the location is very popular among seasoned hitchhikers and alpinists. <b>Mensana Corp.</b>'s cybertech branch offers a small gamut of implants such as subdermal insulation and thermoregulators to help regular adventurers make their way through the lethally cold weather.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Due to its very hostile climate and environment, the region is almost completely devoid of life. A small laboratory used to do meteorological and biological research onto the local wildlife's survival strategies in these arctic climates, but it has been shut down long ago for financial reasons. Its ruins are commonly used by alpinists as a starting point for their adventures.</p>
