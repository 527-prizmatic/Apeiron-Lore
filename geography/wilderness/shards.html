				<p class="content"><a href="../../timeline/cataclysm/downfall.html" target='_parent'>The annihilation of the OSS-Heliostat</a> caused a large amount of small fragments of the shields to fall down to the planet's surface relatively unscathed. One of those shards fell down onto Neo-Caryonite's surface, and a second one managed to stay in orbit around the island's latitudes.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The first fallen shard can still be found some <span class="unit" title="37 miles">60 kilometers</span> west of <b>Zandara-5</b>, in the heart of a dense forest, still lying in the bottom of its impact crater. The shard is approximately <span class="unit" title="2.2 miles">3.5 kilometers</span> across and fractioned in a dozen smaller pieces upon collision, now scattered around its impact crater. The shard was never removed or recycled; instead, a research facility was built in its vicinity to observe how the local biosphere would react to this brutal intrusion and eventually reclaim the crater as its own.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The second shard is still hovering at its programmed altitude, at oscillating latitudes but staying between the 64th and 76th parallels. It has kept its heliostationary behavior, and as such can only be spotted in the middle of the day and only during summer. It is not considered particularly dangerous to Apeiron's security and as such is simply allowed to stay there, as removing it would be way too costly.</p>
