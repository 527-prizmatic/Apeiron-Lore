				<p class="content">Written in history books as the legendary location where <b><a href="../../timeline/cataclysm/aurora.html" target='_parent'>Halkeiro Stellar Techs Inc. conducted their very first rocket launches</a></b>, the small patch of land known as <b>Alianait Island</b> is yet a relatively banal island with very few notable features.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The island is a rather flat piece of land located a few miles northeast of Neo-Caryonite, some <span class="unit" title="12.5 miles">twenty kilometers</span> north of Starcaller Prime. As it hosts a lot of infrastructure which once belonged to the <b>Halkeiro Group</b>, the island legally belonged to the corporation; however, as the Gate was built and Halkeiro moved their headquarters, the island's rights were sold to the city of Starcaller Prime for a symbolic univar.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The island's very flat terrain made it a spot of choice for the construction of a spatioport, but since Halkeiro relocated its infrastructure to the Gate, the island is now deserted, left to its original wildlife, which already started to regain its rights over the corporation's abandoned locals. Every year, the city of Starcaller Prime organizes a ceremony to commemorate its foundation; the ceremony consists in a simple display of fireworks, followed by a speech by the city's mayor and one by Halkeiro's CEO. The event occasionally includes a display of artificial northern lights, but those are quite rare, as the organizers prefer not to meddle too often with the planet's magnetosphere.</p>
