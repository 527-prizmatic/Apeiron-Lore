				<p class="content">Lying at the subduction zone of two tectonic plates, Neo-Caryonite is cut in half by a massive mountain range, running from north to south and separating the island in two nearly distinct halves, and running well beyond the island's lower tip and into the ocean, giving birth to the Frostridge Islands. <b>Mount Canopée</b> is the name given to the range's highest peak, located some <span class="unit" title="74 miles">120 kilometers</span> northeast of Infinium City.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Culminating at an altitude of <span class="unit" title="2.4 miles">3,800 meters</span>, the mountain is not only one of the island's best challenges for experienced mountaineers, but also a place of choice for scientific studies, as its peak stands far above the island's heavy smogs, allowing for clear observations of the night's skies. The mountain's peak hosts three independent observatories working in coordination for accurate mapping of the observable universe, as well as an array of radiotelescopes under control of <b>Halkeiro Stellar Techs Inc.</b>, used for communication with satellites and deep-space probes.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The mountain lies in neutral territory, which means any structure built there must have been approved by all four main cities first. The Halkeiro group experienced this the hard way in 242 PC, when they tried to acquire the rights of the mountain for the installation of a much larger array of radiotelescopes, but the request has been vehemently denied by the entirety of the eperopolis.</p>
