				<h3>Diastrophin</h3>
			
				<p class="content"><b>Diastrophin</b> is the brand name under which is known an artificial nanite created by <b>Mensana Transhuman Biotechs Inc.</b> The molecule was invented in the heart of the Heliostat crisis, in an attempt to take control over Darwinian evolution and massively boost the world's wildlife's evolution rates in order to quickly adapt to the new environmental changes.</p>
				
				<p class="content">This peculiar organic nanite, constituted of three interwoven proteins, has the ability to infiltrate cells and <b>"monitor" environmental conditions</b> through various types of chemical reactions with intracellular substances whose concentration and temperature help determine the animal's direct environment. The nanite also has the ability to interfere with DNA-polymerase to edit the animal's DNA in accordance with the identified environment during cellular duplication, hoping to induce a mutation which could possibly help the animal or its offspring to thrive better in its new environment. The molecule is incapable of self-replication due to its intricate and unstable folding, but this issue would later be countered by the diffusion of large amounts of it into the atmosphere near endangered ecosystems.</p>
				
				<p class="content">It has been found out that diastrophin seems to help speed up natural regeneration of wounds and trauma by slightly increasing the rate of cell mitosis. The exact mechanism behind this is unknown, but it is theorized the nanite's presence has some positive impact on polymerases. The substance has been approved for humanoid use as a regenerating cream, sold under the brand name of <b>Orthodia</b>. The product is relatively expensive, as the production process is quite tedious: the concentration of diastrophin in the product must be perfectly calibrated down to the part per billion, to ensure the random mutation process does not gain enough currency to threaten the body's integrity. Two capsules of it are a must-have in the panoply of any AZN soldier.</p>
				
				<h3>The Infamous MDS-5</h3>
				
				<p class="content">It has later been discovered that when subjected to weak electrical fields, such as neural impulses, diastrophin's structure falls apart and rearranges itself in a much more natural and comfortable fashion. This new structure is known as <b>MDS-5</b>, dubbed after its main structural alterations compared to diastrophin.</p>
				
				<p class="content">Close monitoring showed that this new substance seems to form when diastrophin crosses the blood-brain barrier, then is submitted to the surrounding nerve cells' electric fields, whose energy appears to break down the nanite's weakest hydrogen bonds, making it adopt a more structurally comfortable shape. Being <b>essentially a prion by definition</b>, MDS-5 was found out to function relatively similarly to diastrophin, but in a much more chaotic and destructive way, causing <b>all sorts of harmful mutations</b>, reconfigurating the glial cells and effectively impeding neural functions, inducing all sorts of impairments ranging from loss of attention and amnesia to loss of the senses and paralysis. Those mutations eventually lead to the death of the cells, releasing the prion in the brain to affect more cells and causing brain tissue necrosis and violent cancers.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The prion is a common byproduct of the absorption of large quantities of diastrophin, and due to its very simple creation process, it can be created by any creature that has neurons. </p>
