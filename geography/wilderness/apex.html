				<p class="content"><a href="../cities/infinium.html" target='_parent'>Infinium City</a> is built on the estuary of the <b>Apex River</b>, Neo-Caryonite's second-longest river, taking its source directly from Mount Canop√©e's eternal glaciers. It flows into a particularly large fjord, which is the place most people will picture when thinking about the Apex River.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The river is some <span class="unit" title="117 miles">189 kilometers</span> long, and is a large collection of small tributary torrents all taking their source in various points of the mountains. Stricto sensu, the confluence between the river itself and the fjord it flows into is located some <span class="unit" title="20 miles">32 kilometers</span> upstream from the ocean, and as such the river itself never enters Infinium City; the city is only built around the fjord. However, as the exact confluence between the two is quite difficult to see from an average observer's point of view, the fjord is often considered to be the river itself by extension. The fjord's cliffs get gradually steeper and taller as it gets closer to the ocean, and its width peaks at <span class="unit" title="1.69 miles">2.72 kilometers</span> near the Apex Bridge.</p>
				
				<p class="content">As the fjord's waters are quite calm, many ports and marinas can be found lining its west coast. Those docking points are primarily dedicated to leisure, as the city's commercial harbors are located along the Mothership district's coast. The fjord's waters tend to freeze in winter, reflecting the city's lights into a particularly dazzling spectacle of colorful lights, considered a sight to behold at least once in your life.</p>
