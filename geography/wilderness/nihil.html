				<p class="content">The frozen sea surrounding Apeiron on all sides is known as <b>Ocean Nihil</b>. This quite glum name comes from the fact that due to the extreme coldness of its waters, very few lifeforms have been recorded to live in this ocean. A new influx of new lifeforms has been observed since the beginning of diastrophin mass-production, but it is unsure whether this was due to diastrophin itself or the current climate crisis caused by the OSS-Heliostat.</p>
				
				<p class="content">The northern expanses of the ocean are usually completely frozen <b>up to eleven months a year</b>, causing the northernmost regions such as Starcaller Prime to be covered in ice and rime for the whole duration of their polar winter. In the coldest months of the year, the ice floes tend to expand southward, causing the coastlines all the way down to Volnexar's and Infinium City's to freeze. </p>
