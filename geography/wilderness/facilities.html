				<p class="content">This page gathers a list of the different research facilities found scattered throughout Apeiron's territory.</p>
				
				<h3>Supra-80th Weather Study Center</h3>
				
				<p class="content">This small laboratory lost in the middle of the <a href="glaciers.html" target='_parent'>Kelvin Glaciers</a> belonged to <b>Mensana Inc.</b> It used to study the glaciers' weather and the local wildlife's survival strategies, but was eventually shut down for financial reasons, as not only the upkeep of the laboratory was very expensive due to its location, but the data it returned turned out to not be worth all the trouble. Nowadays, the ruins of the laboratory are a popular meeting point for seasoned mountaineers and hitchhikers looking to cross the Glaciers.</p>
				
				<h3>Experimental Antimatter Power Pylon</h3>
				
				<p class="content">This facility is born of the cooperation between Aurasphere Corp. and the Nova Corporation. Located some <span class="unit" title="25 miles">40 kilometers</span> east of Infinium City, it is a small power plant tinkering with <b>the highly experimental technology of antimatter</b> to find a way to produce viable amounts of energy. Due to antimatter's extraordinary and cataclysmic reactivity with regular matter, the power plant is deemed one of the most unsafe areas to work in within the entirety of Apeiron, and many security measures are aggressively enforced on the facility's grounds to ensure no unfortunate accidents happen.</p>
				
				<h3>Sub-Zero Ocean Observatory</h3>
				
				<p class="content">This small facility lies <b>very close to Apeiron's southwest coast</b>, a few kilometers north of the Frostridge Islands. Its primary directive is to <b>monitor the evolution of marine wildlife</b> when submitted to mutation-inducing amounts of diastrophin. As the research conducted here is not considered particularly confidential, parts of the laboratory are open to the public, which frequently comes to admire the local, one-of-their-kind lifeforms... for a small fee, obviously.</p>
