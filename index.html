					The year is 285 PC. After two millenia of constant technological advancement and rampant industrialization, humanity's hubris led them to unthinkable actions against their own planet, in an ever-growing desire to control the uncontrollable. After three centuries of climatic cataclysms, self-inflicted disasters and crises, and two close calls at complete extinction, man is now actively seeking for a more hospitable planet, where, they hope, they will not commit the same mistakes as before.
				</p>
				<p class="content">
					Among the few territories leading this global effort, the mighty <b>Federation of Far North Technopoleis</b>, colloquially known as <b>Apeiron</b>, spanning over the entirety of the island of Neo-Caryonite, has no equal in terms of technological advancement, total stranglehold over the planet's economy, and socio-economic corporate diktat. Led by a government corrupted to the core, not-so-secretly working hand-in-hand with the planet's mightiest corporations, the only thing driving forward society as a whole is profit, and whoever is unable to contribute is eliminated to make way for those who can. In a world where only the rich and influent ones can thrive, what can the rest of the population possibly do to assert their own rights?
